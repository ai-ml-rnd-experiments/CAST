Festen (also known as The Celebration) is a 1998 Danish black comedy-drama film directed by Thomas Vinterberg and produced by Nimbus Film.With a budget of US$1.3 million, the film tells the story of a family gathering to celebrate their father's 60th birthday. It is a dark comedy juggling subjects of death, trauma and family. Vinterberg was inspired to write it with Mogens Rukov, based on a hoax broadcast by a Danish radio station.[1]It was the first Dogme 95 film, an artistic movement created by Danish directors Vinterberg and Lars von Trier. The movement preferred simple and analog production values to allow for the highlighting of plot and performance. Festen was selected as the Danish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 71st Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.
