Shanghai Express is a 1932 American pre-Code film directed by Josef von Sternberg and starring Marlene Dietrich, Clive Brook, Anna May Wong, and Warner Oland. It was written by Jules Furthman, based on a 1931 short story by Harry Hervey. Shanghai Express was the fourth of seven films von Sternberg and Dietrich made together.Shanghai Express was released during the midst of the Great Depression. The film was remade as Night Plane from Chungking (1943) and Peking Express (1951).In 1931, China is embroiled in a civil war. Friends of British Captain Donald "Doc" Harvey (Clive Brook) envy him because the fabulously notorious Shanghai Lily (Marlene Dietrich) is a fellow passenger on the express train from Peking to Shanghai. Because the name means nothing to him, they inform him that she is a "coaster" or "woman who lives by her wits along the China coast" â€“ in other words, a courtesan.
