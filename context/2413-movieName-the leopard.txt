The Leopard (Italian: Il Gattopardo, "The Serval"; alternative title "Le Guépard", The Cheetah") is a 1963 Italian epic period drama film by director Luchino Visconti, based on Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's 1958 novel of the same title.[5]The film features an international cast including the American Burt Lancaster, the Frenchman Alain Delon, the Italian Claudia Cardinale (who is dubbed in the Italian version by Solvejg D'Assunta because her native tongue was Sicilian and French) and Terence Hill (Mario Girotti). In the Italian language 185 minute version, Lancaster's lines are dubbed into Italian by Corrado Gaipa; while in the 161 minute U.S. English dubbed version, Lancaster's original voice work is heard.The film won the Palme d’Or at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival,[6] and was released theatrically in Italy by Titanus on March 28, 1963 and in France on June 14. It was a critical and commercial success in Europe, but reception was more lukewarm in the United States, where a shorter, English-dubbed cut was released. Retrospective reviews, drawn from the film’s longer original cut, have been more positive, and the film is now widely-regarded as a classic.
