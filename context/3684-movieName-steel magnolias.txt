Steel Magnolias is a 1989 American comedy-drama film directed by Herbert Ross and starring Sally Field, Dolly Parton, Shirley MacLaine, Daryl Hannah, Olympia Dukakis and Julia Roberts.

She was portrayed in the film version by Julia Roberts.The title suggests the main female characters can be both as delicate as the magnolia flower, and as tough as steel.[4]Annelle Dupuy (Daryl Hannah), a shy, awkward beauty school graduate, moves to a northwestern Louisiana town where Truvy Jones (Dolly Parton) hires her to work in her home-based beauty salon.
