The Cup is a 2011 Australian biographical film about the 2002 Melbourne Cup race, won by the Dermot Weld trained Media Puzzle. And is directed by Simon Wincer.[1] It is about Damien Oliver's victory in the 2002 Melbourne Cup.[2] This was Bill Hunter's final film before his death.The Melbourne Cup is called The Race That Stops a Nation, but never in the history of Australia's 150-year-old Thoroughbred Classic has there been so dramatic a contest as the 2002 running. The Cup follows the world's finest horsemen as they plot their paths across the globe - from Europe, the Middle East, and Asia - and into the Winners Circle of the richest and most prestigious two-mile handicap. But the heart of this true story is a young Australian jockey, Damien Oliver, who loses his only brother in a tragic racing accident just days before the great race. To make matters worse, the same fate claimed Damien and Jason Oliver's father decades before.
