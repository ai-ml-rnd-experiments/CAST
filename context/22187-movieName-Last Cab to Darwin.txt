Last Cab to Darwin is a 2015 Australian film directed by Jeremy Sims and written by Sims and Reg Cribb. Based on Cribb's 2003 play of the same name, it stars Michael Caton, Ningali Lawford, Mark Coles Smith, Emma Hamilton, and Jacki Weaver, who was in the original cast of the play. Like the play, the film was inspired by the true story of Max Bell, a taxi driver who traveled from Broken Hill to Darwin to seek euthanasia after he was diagnosed with a terminal illness.Rex, a taxi driver in his 70s, has spent nearly his entire life in the New South Wales city of Broken Hill. He has a close relationship with his Aboriginal neighbor Polly, but because of racial tensions, is resistant to becoming romantically involved. Rex's life changes when he is diagnosed with cancer and told he will not survive longer than three months. Refusing to become committed to a hospital, he learns that a euthanasia device has been invented by Dr. Nicole Farmer at a clinic in the Northern Territory capital city of Darwin.
