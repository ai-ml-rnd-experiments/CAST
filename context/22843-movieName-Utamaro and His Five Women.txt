Utamaro and His Five Women or Five Women Around Utamaro (Japanese: æ­Œéº¿ã‚’ã‚ãã‚‹äº”äººã®å¥³, Hepburn: Utamaro o meguru gonin no onna) is a 1946 Japanese film directed by Kenji Mizoguchi. It is based on the novel of the same title by Kanji Kunieda, itself a fictionalized account of the life of printmaker Kitagawa Utamaro. It was Mizoguchi's first film made under the American occupation.Mizoguchi was fascinated by painting and had trained as a painter as a young man. Kitagawa Utamaro (1756-1806) was 'possibly the greatest of all the portraitists of the floating world' - he painted also idyllic outdoor scenes, Yoshiwara festivals and drinking bouts, bathers and shell-divers, as well as erotica. The film dramatically presents this sense of range, and openness to life's variety, and contrasts the old official court-approved style of painting, called kano with the new, dynamic form of painting known as ukiyo-e (literally:paintings of the floating world).The story is set in Edo (now TÅkyÅ) in Japan.The film starts with a parade of samurai and their concubines (oiran, distinguished by their high shoes) along an avenue of cherry trees.
