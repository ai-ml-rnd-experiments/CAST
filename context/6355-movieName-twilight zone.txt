Twilight Zone: The Movie is a 1983 American science fiction horror anthology film produced by Steven Spielberg and John Landis as a cinematic interpretation of the 1959â€“1964 television series of the same name created by Rod Serling.[3] The film stars Vic Morrow, Scatman Crothers, Kathleen Quinlan, and John Lithgow, with Dan Aykroyd and Albert Brooks in the prologue segment. Burgess Meredith starred in four episodes of the original series and took on Serling's position as narrator. Other actors from the original series included William Schallert, Kevin McCarthy, Bill Mumy, Murray Matheson, Peter Brocco, and Patricia Barry.The film is a remake of three episodes of the original series and introduces one original story. Landis directed the prologue and the first segment; Spielberg directed the second segment, Joe Dante the third, and George Miller the final. Dante recalled that the four stories were originally intended to be interwoven, with characters from one segment appearing in another segment, but problems with the filming precluded this.[4]The film gained notoriety before its release for the stunt helicopter crash which killed two children, child actors Renee Shin-Yi Chen and Myca Dinh Le (aged 6 and 7 years), and actor Vic Morrow during the filming of the scene directed by Landis in Santa Clarita.
