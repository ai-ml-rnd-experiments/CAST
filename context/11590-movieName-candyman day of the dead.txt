Candyman: Day of the Dead (Also known as Candyman 3: Day of the Dead) is a 1999 American supernatural slasher film that was directed by Turi Meyer and starring Tony Todd and Donna D'Errico. It was the third installment in the Candyman series[1] and would be followed by Candyman (2021).Years after the events of the second film, the ghostly serial killer returns once again from beyond the grave, this time during the eve of Day of the Dead to haunt a Los Angeles art gallery owner named Caroline McKeever who is a direct descendant of the Candyman and Annie Tarrant's daughter (and also the reincarnation of Candyman’s daughter Isabel) in order for him to claim her soul so she would be next to him. In the meantime, the Candyman goes around killing all of those who are associated with Caroline (including an artist named Miguel Velasco, his lover Lena and Caroline’s roommate Tamara) in his usual gory ways with his hook. He also kidnaps her friend named David de la Paz and makes it appear to the authorities that Caroline was the one that was responsible for the killings. A seasoned police detective named L.V. Sacco is murdered by the Candyman while Caroline is in the car which not only brings the whole local police department down on her head, but puts her in the firing line of Sacco's partner Lt.
