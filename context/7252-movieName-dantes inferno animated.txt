Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic is a direct to DVD animated dark fantasy action film released on February 9, 2010. Based on Dante's Inferno video game which is itself loosely based on Dante's Inferno,[1][2] Dante must travel through the circles of Hell and battle demons, creatures, monsters, and even Lucifer himself to save his beloved Beatrice.Returning from the Third Crusade, Dante arrives home to find his servants slain, his father dead and his beloved fiancee Beatrice dying of a stab wound to the stomach. As she dies, she turns into a spirit and begins to ascend into Heaven. However, a shadowy Lucifer plucks Beatrice from the sky and into the gates of Hell. Dante gives chase and follows them into Hell.Dante fights off and slaughters a mob of creatures, but is captured by a score of serpent-like arms which sow a red cross into his chest and torso - a living tapestry detailing his greatest sins in life. Virgil appears and offers to guide him through Hell; Dante, invoking his faith, tears open the gates and enters.
