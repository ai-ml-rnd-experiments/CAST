Night Train is a 2009 direct-to-video mystery thriller film produced by Rifkin-Eberts Productions and stars Danny Glover, Leelee Sobieski, Steve Zahn and Matthias Schweigh√∂fer. It pays homage to a variety of classic suspense films such as Strangers on a Train (1951), The Lady Vanishes (1938), and The Maltese Falcon (1941), though the plot bears only passing resemblance to any of them. The film did not appear in theaters and was released on DVD for US markets in July 2009.One Christmas night, a man runs through a forest carrying something. A nearly deserted train pulls into a station and two conductors get out, take a stretch, and kill time as no one seems to board. Just as the train is about to depart, the running man calls out, runs to the train and seems to want to board. He does not speak and, assuming that perhaps he does not know English, the conductors let him on with the intention of getting his money later. He joins two of the only five passengers who appear to be on the train at that point.
