Fist of Fury (also known as The Chinese Connection) is a 1972 Hong Kong action martial arts film written and directed by Lo Wei, produced by Raymond Chow, and starring Bruce Lee in his second major role after The Big Boss (1971).[3] Lee plays Chen Zhen, a student of Huo Yuanjia, who fights to defend the honor of the Chinese in the face of foreign aggression, and to bring to justice those responsible for his master's death.[3]The film was produced by the Orange Sky Golden Harvest film production company, still in its infancy at the time. Directed by Lo Wei, this was Bruce Lee's second kung fu film. The film, which touches on sensitive issues surrounding Japanese colonialism, features "realistic combat choreography". It differs from other films in the genre for its historical and social references, especially to Japanese imperialism.[4]The film grossed an estimated US$100 million worldwide (equivalent to over $600 million adjusted for inflation), against a budget of $100,000. It was the highest-grossing Hong Kong film up until Lee's The Way of the Dragon (1972).
