Biddle Cadwalader Memorial Prize at the school's experimental-painting-and-sculpture contest. Six Men Getting Sick received a home-media release in 2001 as part of The Short Films of David Lynch DVD, and it has been noted by critics as containing a similar narrative structure to his 1977 debut feature film Eraserhead.Six Men Getting Sick consists of a one-minute animation of a painting by David Lynch looped four times and accompanied by a soundtrack of a siren wailing.
