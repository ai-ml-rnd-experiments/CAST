Blonde Ambition is a 2007 American romantic comedy film directed by Scott Marshall and starring Jessica Simpson as a small-town girl who moves to New York City and rises up into a career as a business woman. The film also stars Luke Wilson, Rachael Leigh Cook, Penelope Ann Miller, Andy Dick, Drew Fuller, Larry Miller and Willie Nelson.Before the film started filming, sources reported that Blonde Ambition was a remake of the 1988 film Working Girl. After learning about this rumor, Simpson told Empire in November 2006, "It's definitely the theme of Working Girl â€“ this small town girl moving to New York City and rising up into this great career as a business woman pretty much. But it's definitely not a remake." She also described Blonde Ambition as "more of a knockabout comedy" than Working Girl, which "had one foot in drama".[2]When Katie Gregerstitch, from Minden, Louisiana, visits her boyfriend Billy, an aspiring model, in New York City, she catches him in bed with another woman. Thus, Billy breaks up with Katie, who then leaves to stay with her close friend Haley.
