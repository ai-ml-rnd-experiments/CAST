The robberâ€™s Smith & Wesson Model 29 revolver falls to the ground and lands directly in front of Eugene Hunt, a commodities trader and one of the customers lying on the floor.

Because the robber's weapon was not found at the scene and the other witnesses are unclear about seeing a handgun, Turner is accused of killing an unarmed man.
