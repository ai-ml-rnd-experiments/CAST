Johnny Got His Gun is a 1971 American drama anti-war film written and directed by Dalton Trumbo based on his 1939 novel of the same name, with an uncredited writing collaboration by Luis Bu√±uel. The film stars Timothy Bottoms, Kathy Fields, Marsha Hunt, Jason Robards, Donald Sutherland and Diane Varsi.Although a minor success on initial release, it was largely forgotten soon after by mass audiences. It became far better known when it was incorporated in the video of Metallica's song "One", whose popularity subsequently turned Johnny Got His Gun into a cult film. Eventually, Metallica bought the film rights in order to keep showing the music video without having to pay additional royalty fees.[4]Joe Bonham (Bottoms), a young American soldier hit by an artillery shell during World War I, lies in a hospital bed. He is a quadruple amputee who has also lost his eyes, ears, mouth and nose. He remains conscious and able to reason, but his wounds render him a prisoner in his own body.
