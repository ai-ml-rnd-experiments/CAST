A Troll in Central Park (released in some countries as Stanley's Magic Garden) is a 1994 American animated musical fantasy-comedy film directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman.[3] The film features the voice talents of Dom DeLuise, Cloris Leachman, Charles Nelson Reilly, Phillip Glasser, Tawny Sunshine Glover, Hayley Mills, and Jonathan Pryce. It is the last Don Bluth film to star Dom DeLuise.Released in the United States on October 7, 1994, by Warner Bros., the film received extremely negative reviews from critics and grossed $71,368 at the North American box office, becoming a box-office bomb. Many professional critics have regarded it as Bluth's worst film.Stanley is a troll with a magical green thumb, able to bring flowers and plants to life at a touch, which is forbidden in his home, the Kingdom of Trolls. When he is discovered doing so, the other trolls arrest him and take him to Gnorga, the queen of the trolls, who concludes that Stanley "gives a bad name to trolls everywhere" and demands that he be transformed to stone with her dark thumb (which is also purple when it glows).
