Sucker Punch is a 2011 American psychological fantasy action film directed by Zack Snyder and co-written by Snyder and Steve Shibuya. It is Snyder's first film based on an original concept.[5][6] The film stars Emily Browning[7] as "Babydoll", a young woman who is committed to a mental institution and copes by envisioning it as a brothel. She teams up with four dancers/prisoners to escape before her scheduled lobotomy. As she collects the items she needs to escape, she enters another level of fantasy in which the women become strong, experienced warriors. Each fantasy is a parallel to the events in the brothel. Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, and Jamie Chung portray the four prisoners whom Babydoll imagines as dancers. Carla Gugino plays Dr.
