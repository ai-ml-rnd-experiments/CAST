It was described to be in the style of an "overly dramatic telenovela" and tells the story of Armando √lvarez, who must save his father's ranch from a powerful drug lord. Casa de mi padre was released on March 16, 2012.Armando √lvarez (Will Ferrell) has lived and worked on his father's ranch in Mexico his entire life. As the ranch encounters financial difficulties, Armando's younger brother Ra√∫l (Diego Luna), shows up with his new fianc√©e, Sonia (G√©nesis Rodr√≠guez). It seems that Ra√∫l's success as an international businessman means the ranch's troubles are over as he pledges to settle all debts his father has incurred. But when Armando falls for Sonia, and Ra√∫l's business dealings turn out to be less than legitimate, all hell breaks loose as they find themselves in a war with Mexico's most feared drug lord, the mighty Onza (Gael Garc√≠a Bernal).[2]Dan Haggerty, who famously portrayed the titular character in the popular television series The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams, appears as himself in a post-credits cameo.
