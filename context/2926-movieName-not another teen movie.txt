After Jake discovers that Priscilla is now dating timid and weird Les just to spite him, one of Jake's friends, Austin, makes a bet with him to turn Janey Briggs, a "uniquely rebellious girl," into the prom queen.Jake attempts to court Janey's love, but faces adversity from his own sister, Catherine, who is sexually attracted to him; Janey's unnoticed admirer and best friend, Ricky Lipman; and memories from his past football career. Catherine eventually assists her brother by "drastically" altering Janey's appearance (which is simply removing her glasses and ponytail), instantly making her drop-dead gorgeous.
