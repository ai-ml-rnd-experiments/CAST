GodFilms is a video production unit of Discipleship Ministries, an international agency of The United Methodist Church. Based in Nashville, Tennessee, United States, GodFilms produces short films for Christian small groups and in 2008 produced the denomination's first feature-length movie since the 1960s. Although part of The United Methodist Church, GodFilms productions are for Christians of all denominations.Digital Diary is the first small group series by GodFilms and is available in Cokesbury bookstores and at Cokesbury.com. Each 10-12 minute short film features an individual on a mysterious and introspective journey to understand where God is in their life. And each journey features a "digital diary" that causes them to reopen their life to Jesus' teachings. Helping unravel the mystery is a 32-page leader's guide with Biblical references and study questions.
