Seed of Chucky is a 2004 American black comedy slasher film, the fifth installment of the Child's Play series, and sequel to 1998's Bride of Chucky as well as the first film to be distributed by another company since Child's Play. The film was written and directed by Don Mancini, who created the series and has written all of the films (except the 2019 remake). With this entry, Mancini made his directorial debut. The film is set six years after Child's Play 3 and Bride of Chucky and follows a young doll named Glen, the son of Chucky and Tiffany, resurrecting his parents, causing chaos.The film, shot in Romania, continues the series' evolution from the pure horror genre of the first three films to a hybrid horror-comedy.[3][4] It was the last Child's Play film from the original continuity to be released in theaters, with all future installments to be released direct-to-video until the 2019 remake, fifteen years later. The film was followed by another sequel, Curse of Chucky, released on home video and Netflix in 2013.The film was a critical and commercial failure, with chief criticisms being the excessive use of unfunny humor, ridiculous plot, and for being yet another unnecessary sequel.
