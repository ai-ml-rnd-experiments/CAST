The Chinese title of the movie is a heterograph of å…„å¦¹ (xiÅng mÃ¨i), which means "elder brother and younger sister".Tseng, a successful young politician, wants to start a family but his wife, Yi-hsi, opposes his decision because she has emotional problems and feels that she cannot accept the responsibility of motherhood. He manages to convince her to adopt a girl called Tien, but they are not sure about the child's background. The girl behaves strangely and hardly speaks, except to a doll she carries with her all the time. Once, the housekeeper throws away the doll after it caused the washing machine to be jammed, but she is attacked by a strange force and ends up in hospital later. On another occasion in school, two boys try to bully Tien but the teacher, Ms Chung, finds the bullies tied up together by red strings later.
