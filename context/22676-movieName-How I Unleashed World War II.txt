How I Unleashed World War II (Polish: Jak rozpÄ™taÅ‚em drugÄ… wojnÄ™ Å›wiatowÄ…) is a Polish feature film made in 1969, based on Kazimierz SÅ‚awiÅ„ski's novel "Przygody kanoniera Dolasa" (The adventures of Dolas the cannoneer). It was shot in Sochi, Baku, PoÅ›wiÄ™tne and ÅÃ³dÅº, among other places.The film was divided into three parts:Originally black and white, it was digitally colorized in 2001 by the Hollywood company Dynacs Digital Studios, as requested by the Studio Filmowe "Oko" and TV Polsat.[citation needed]The movie tells the story of a Polish soldier Franciszek (Franek) Dolas, whoâ€”as a result of comical coincidencesâ€”is convinced that he started the Second World War. Trying to redeem himself at all costs, he constantly gets into new trouble. In doing so, he finds himself on different war fronts (Yugoslavia, Mediterranean Sea, Middle East, Italy) and eventually returns to Poland.In a particularly famous scene, Dolas is questioned by a German-speaking Gestapo officer in Austria and answers that his name is "Grzegorz BrzÄ™czyszczykiewicz"; the officer gets increasingly frustrated trying to write the fictitious Polish name.[1][2]
