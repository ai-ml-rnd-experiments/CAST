In south Florida, a high school counselor is accused of rape by two female students, but the police officer investigating suspects something more is going on.The film gained notoriety for its sex scenes – including a scene of lesbianism between Campbell and Richards, and another depicting a threesome between the two actresses and Dillon – that were more explicit than typically seen in mainstream Hollywood releases. An uncut version, which adds seven minutes to the film's runtime, was released on DVD in 2004.[5]Wild Things was followed by three direct-to-DVD sequels: Wild Things 2 (2004), Wild Things: Diamonds in the Rough (2005) and Wild Things: Foursome (2010).Miami area high school guidance counselor Sam Lombardo is accused of rape by two female students, wealthy and popular Kelly Van Ryan and poor outcast Suzie Toller.
