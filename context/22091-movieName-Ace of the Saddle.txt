Ace of the Saddle is a 1919 American western film directed by John Ford and featuring Harry Carey. The film is considered to be lost.[1]As described in a film magazine,[2] Cheyenne Harry Henderson (Carey) owns a cattle ranch on the border of two counties, with Yucca County controlled by outlaws and Pinkerton County law abiding. After the Yucca sheriff (Harris) refuses to help stop the cattle rustling, he goes to Pinkerton Sheriff Faulkner (Lee), who is unable to help him because he lives in Yucca County. Harry meets and becomes romantically involved with Sheriff Faulkner's daughter Madeline (Barry), who is also loved by the Yucca sheriff. Because she hates guns, Harry gives up using them. While Yucca County may be lawless, no man may be shot unless he is armed, so the Yucca sheriff devises a scheme place an unloaded gun in Harry's hands and then have him killed. Harry sees through the ruse and uses the sheriff's gun to kill two men before they can shoot him.
