She's on Duty (Korean: 잠복근무; RR: Jambokgeunmu; lit. "Stakeout" or "Undercover") is a 2005 South Korean film about a police detective (Kim Sun-a) who goes undercover in a high school to befriend the daughter (Nam Sang-mi) of an elusive gangster.[2][3]Despite being heavily marketed, the film was generally considered a box office disappointment.Chun Jae-in, an orphan-turned-police detective, is assigned a job to go undercover in a high school to befriend Seung-hee, the daughter of notorious gangster Cha Young-jae, and protect her from any of her father's enemies who may want to use her as bait to get Cha Young-jae to do what they want, as well as get information about her father's work from her. At first, Jae-in is very reluctant to accept the job; however, her uncle, also a detective, pushes her at the last minute to take it. Jae-in is considered a loser when she first steps into her class, and the gang girls confront her afterward and challenge her to a fight at the backyard of the school. Jae-in, being a policewoman, easily beats them up. This earns her some sort of respect, although what Jae-in really wants is Seung-hee's friendship.
