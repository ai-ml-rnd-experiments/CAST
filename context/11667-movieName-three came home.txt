Three Came Home is a 1950 American post-war film directed by Jean Negulesco, based on the memoirs of the same name by writer Agnes Newton Keith.

Keith was initially interned at Berhala Island near Sandakan, North Borneo (today's Sabah) but spent most of her captivity at Batu Lintang camp at Kuching, Sarawak. The camp was liberated in September 1945.Adapted and produced by Nunnally Johnson, the film stars Claudette Colbert. It is now in the public domain and so is available to watch in its entirety online at no charge.[4]American-born Agnes Keith (Colbert) and her British husband Harry Keith (Patric Knowles) live a comfortable colonial life in North Borneo with their young son George in the 1930s. Keith is the only American in Sandakan.
