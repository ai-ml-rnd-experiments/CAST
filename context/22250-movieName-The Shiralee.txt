The Shiralee is a 1987 Australian television film directed by George Ogilvie, based on the 1955 novel of the same name by D'Arcy Niland.It was originally filmed as a mini series and was shot in Adelaide and Quorn, South Australia.[2]The plot revolves around an itinerant rural worker and fighter — sometimes described as a "swagman" or "swaggie" — named Macauley (Bryan Brown) who unexpectedly finds himself taking responsibility for his child. The film contrasts the harshness of Australian masculinity with a parent-child relationship.A loner formerly from the city, Macauley finds himself in a small country town where he falls for the local butchers daughter, Lily. Their romance is thwarted, however, by a jealous rival and after a misunderstanding Macauley finds himself back on the road and later working as a boxer in a travelling carnival. During a stopover in the old town, Macauley hopes to meet up again with Lily, only to find her married. Devastated, he turns to a fellow carnival-worker, Marge, and promises to marry her and move to the city, much to the concern of his friends who can see he doesn't love her and that the relationship is set to fail.
