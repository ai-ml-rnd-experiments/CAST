The film includes the perspective of the scientists who invented the process, and of the genetic engineers who are applying the process. The CRISPR process, a 2013 breakthrough in biology, provides a way of controlling the basic genetic processes of life, and may help cure diseases, and many more benefits to humankind and the human impact on the environment.In addition, the film documentary considers several relevant questions including, How will this new gene-editing ability change our relationship with nature? and, What will this new gene-editing ability mean for human evolution? The film, in beginning to answer such questions, presents a review of the distant past, and takes an educated look into the, perhaps, not-too-distant future.Significantly, the film features the story of David Sanchez, a young man with sickle cell disease.
