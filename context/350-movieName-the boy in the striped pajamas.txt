The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (released as The Boy in the Striped Pajamas in North America) is a 2008 tragedy film written and directed by Mark Herman. It is based on the 2006 novel of the same name by John Boyne. Set in World War II, the Holocaust drama relates the horror of a Nazi extermination camp through the eyes of two 8-year-old boys: Bruno (Asa Butterfield), the son of the camp's Nazi commandant, and Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), a Jewish inmate. It was released in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2008.The film has drawn criticism from some Holocaust educators for its factual inaccuracy, and emphasis on greater sympathy for the Nazi German family centred in the story, than for the Jewish victims of the Holocaust.[citation needed]Bruno is a young boy living in Berlin in Nazi Germany during World War II. His father Ralf gets promoted, and relocates the family to the "countryside" (occupied Poland). Living without neighbours, far from any town, and with no friends to play with, Bruno becomes lonely and bored.
