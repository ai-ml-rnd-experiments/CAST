My Dearest Enemy is an Israeli documentary that takes a behind-the-scenes look at Israel's secret diplomacy by sharing the highly anticipated meeting between Israeli Amnon Lipkin-Shahak and Palestinian Hani El Hassanâ€”both powerful leaders in opposite camps.The film follows a heated conference between two men who have the power to instigate change. Amnon was the chief-of-staff of Israel's military, and Hani was one of Yasser Arafatâ€™s right-hand men. The filmmakers worked exhaustingly to organize this unofficial meeting between two powerful people who have more in common than might be expected.â€œWeâ€™ve worked on this handshake for more than a year,â€ the filmmaker says as Amnon enters the room and greets Hani.This is the first time that the two leaders have met face to face, but it's not the first time they've come in contact with each other. In 1968, Amnon led an Israeli offensive that faced Palestinian guerrilla soldiers led by Hani, and in 1973 both men were in Beirut during Israel's raid on Lebanon. Now, instead of interacting from behind guns, the two sit comfortably in an air-conditioned room, talking over finely prepared meals and red wine.
