Beauty & the Briefcase is a 2010 American romantic comedy television film directed by Gil Junger, based on the novel Diary of a Working Girl by Daniella Brodsky.[1] The film stars Hilary Duff as a fashion journalist who works undercover to write an article on dating businessmen. It premiered on ABC Family on April 18, 2010.[2]Joanne, a fashion photographer, helps her friend, Lane Daniels (Hilary Duff), an aspiring writer, get in to see Kate White, primary editor at Cosmopolitan magazine, to pitch a story idea - which does not go well. On the way out the door, Lane tells Kate about her elaborate check-list and how hard it is to find a good man, which leads to Kate assigning Lane the task of joining the business world to find a man who checks all the criteria of her "list", amongst all those eligible "downtown" bachelors, and writing an article about that. She is to go undercover and look for her "magic man" (one for whom she has a lengthy checklist of desirable attributes, as opposed to her friend Joanne's checklist which consists of: 1- breathing, and 2- cute). With a fraudulent résumé, Lane bluffs, bumbles, and sabotages her way into getting an administrative assistant position in the Corporate Strategic Planning department of a major investment firm. She is to work for Tom Rinehart (Michael McMillian), Managing Director, who is a bit of a quirky 'stick in the mud' when it comes to personal 'risk-taking'.
