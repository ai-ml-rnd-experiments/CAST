Neshoba: The Price of Freedom is a 2008 documentary film about events and attitudes in Neshoba County, Mississippi, especially the 1964 murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. The film premiered at the 2008 Indie Memphis Film Festival, where it won the Jury Award for Best Documentary.[1]Neshoba explores the history and changing racial attitudes of Neshoba County, Mississippi four decades after the murders of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner during Freedom Summer. The film captures the trial of Edgar Ray Killen, who granted the filmmakers "extraordinary access".[2]Though critical of certain production elements, Variety praised Neshoba as "a disturbing peek at how little some people have changed, as well as an inspiring portrait of others' determination to see crime punished at last".[3]
