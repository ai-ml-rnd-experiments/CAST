A Lonely Place to Die is a 2011 British action thriller film[2] directed by Julian Gilbey[3] and based on a screenplay from Julian and Will Gilbey.[4] It stars Melissa George, Ed Speleers, Karel Roden, Eamonn Walker, Sean Harris and Kate Magowan.[5]Mountaineers Alison, Ed and Rob meet up with friends Jenny and Alex for a climbing and hiking trip in the Scottish Highlands. Whilst taking a break for lunch, they discover Anna, a young girl buried alive in a small chamber in the wilderness. They are unable to communicate with her as she speaks no English, with Ed guessing she might be Croatian. Deciding they need to get her to safety, Alison and Rob elect to take a shortcut to the nearest village to fetch help, but the route involves having to abseil down a high cliff named "Devils Drop". During their descent, Rob's rope apparently breaks, causing him to fall to his death. Alison is pelted with falling debris as she tumultuously reaches the bottom, whereupon she discovers Rob's rope was cut.
