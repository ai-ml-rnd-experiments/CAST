Hugo is a 2011 American adventure drama film[5] directed and produced by Martin Scorsese, and adapted for the screen by John Logan. Based on Brian Selznick's 2007 book The Invention of Hugo Cabret, it tells the story of a boy who lives alone in the Gare Montparnasse railway station in Paris in the 1930s, only to become embroiled in a mystery surrounding his late father's automaton and the pioneering filmmaker Georges Méliès.Hugo is Scorsese's first film shot in 3D, about which the filmmaker remarked, "I found 3D to be really interesting, because the actors were more upfront emotionally. Their slightest move, their slightest intention is picked up much more precisely."[6] The film was released in the United States on November 23, 2011.[7]Hugo received 11 Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture), more than any other film that year, winning five: Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Visual Effects.[8] It was also nominated for eight BAFTAs, and won two, and was nominated for three Golden Globe awards, earning Scorsese his third Golden Globe Award for Best Director. Despite receiving acclaim from critics, the film was a box office failure, grossing just $185 million against its estimated $150 million budget.
