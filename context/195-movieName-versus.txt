The film is set somewhere in the deep forest of Japan, known as the Forest of Resurrection, where an escaped convict simply referred to as "Prisoner KSC2-303" and a gang of Yakuza battle a horde of zombies while at the same time dealing with their sinister leader who wishes to open the forest's portal of darkness.The film was originally intended as a sequel to Kitamura's short film Down to Hell but was later developed as a stand-alone film. Principal photography was originally intended to last 3 weeks but was extended to 7 months due to weather and financial issues.Versus premiered at the Tokyo International Fantastic Film Festival on October 29, 2000. In 2004, an expanded edition titled Ultimate Versus was released which included 10 minutes of new footage, as well as improved music, effects, credits, and edits.Unknown to the world, there are 666 portals on Earth that connect this world to the other side which are concealed from human beings. However, there are some who are aware of their existence and are willing to locate and open the gates of the portals to obtain the power of darkness for their own use.
