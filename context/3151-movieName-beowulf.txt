Pictures handling international distribution. The film received moderately positive reviews from critics, who complimented the visual effects, motion capture and voice acting whilst criticising aspects of the interpretation of the poem, but the film was a commercial disappointment, having earned only $196.4 million on a $150 million budget.In 507, the legendary Geatish warrior Beowulf travels to Denmark with his band of soldiers including his best friend Wiglaf. They meet King Hrothgar, who needs a hero to slay Grendel, a hideously malformed troll-like creature with appalling strength and cunning who attacked and killed many of Hrothgar's warriors during a celebration in the mead hall Heorot.
