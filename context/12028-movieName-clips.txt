Clip (Serbian: Клип, romanized: Klip) is a 2012 Serbian drama film written and directed by Maja Miloš, her first time directing, and starring Isidora Simijonović in her first film role. The film's title derives from the many short cell phone videos made by the film's central character, Jasna (Simijonović), a troubled teenager whose family is falling apart. The film was released in Serbia on 12 April 2012 at Belgrade's Sava Centar. Simijonović won the award for the best actress at the Vilnius International Film Festival[1] and 'The Golden Hazelnut' (Zlatni lešnik) award for the best actress at the fifth International Festival of Film Direction in Leskovac.[2]The film currently holds a rating of 43% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 54 on Metacritic, which uses a weighted scoring method.Due to its realistic depiction of sex between minors (Simijonović was 14 when production began), the film was banned in Russia as child pornography.[3] In interviews, Miloš said that prosthetics, dildos, special visual effects, and body doubles had been used, and that the film had a long post-production period.[4][5]This article related to a Serbian film is a stub.
