Smith and Eric Darnell[12] from a script written by Michael Colton, John Aboud[1] and Brandon Sawyer,[3] Penguins of Madagascar was released theatrically on November 26, 2014 in both 2D and 3D,[1] making it the only film in the Madagascar franchise to be distributed by 20th Century Fox as well as the final DreamWorks Animation film to be produced by Pacific Data Images prior to its closure on January 22, 2015, as well as DWA Glendale taking over.[13] While the film received generally positive reviews from critics, it also underperformed at the US box office (forcing a write-down for the studio), but did better internationally, grossing $373 million on a $132 million budget.[14]Prior to the events of Madagascar, Skipper, Rico, and Kowalski are chicks in a penguin colony in Antarctica. An egg rolls away from the colony, and the trio rescue it from leopard seals, but are set adrift on an iceberg.
