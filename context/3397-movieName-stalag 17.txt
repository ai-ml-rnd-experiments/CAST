Stalag 17 is a 1953 American comedy-drama war film which tells the story of a group of American airmen held in a German World War II prisoner of war camp, who come to suspect that one of their number is an informant. The film was adapted by Billy Wilder and Edwin Blum from the Broadway play of the same name by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski, which was based on their experiences as prisoners in Stalag 17B in Austria.Produced and directed by Wilder, it starred William Holden in his Oscar-winning role, Don Taylor, Robert Strauss, Harvey Lembeck, Peter Graves, Neville Brand, Richard Erdman, Sig Ruman, and Otto Preminger. Strauss and Lembeck both appeared in the original Broadway production.Stalag 17 begins on "the longest night of the year" in December 1944 in a Luftwaffe prisoner-of-war camp somewhere along the Danube River. The story is narrated by Clarence Harvey "Cookie" Cook. The camp holds Poles, Czechs, Russian women and, in the American compound, 640 sergeants from bomber crews, gunners, radiomen, and flight engineers.Two Americans, Manfredi and Johnson, try to escape through a tunnel, but are shot by waiting guards when they emerge outside the barbed wire fence.
