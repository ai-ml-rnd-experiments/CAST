Jaws 3-D (stylized on-screen as Jaws III and released on home media as Jaws 3) is a 1983 American horror[3] thriller[4] film directed by Joe Alves and starring Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Lea Thompson and Louis Gossett Jr..[5] It is the sequel to Jaws 2 and the third installment in the Jaws franchise. The film follows the Brody children from the previous films at an aquatic park in Florida with underwater tunnels and lagoons. As the park prepares for opening, a young great white shark infiltrates the park from the sea, seemingly attacking and killing the park's employees. Once the shark is captured, however, it becomes apparent that the real culprit was a second, much larger shark that also entered the park.The film made use of 3D during the revived interest in the technology in the 1980s, amongst other horror films such as Friday the 13th Part III and Amityville 3-D. Cinema audiences could wear disposable cardboard polarized 3D glasses to create the illusion that elements protrude from the screen.
