Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me is a 1992 psychological horror[3][4] film directed by David Lynch and written by Lynch and Robert Engels. It serves as a prequel and sequel to the television series Twin Peaks (1990â€“1991), created by Mark Frost and Lynch, who were also executive producers. The film revolves around the investigation into the murder of Teresa Banks (Pamela Gidley) and the last seven days in the life of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), a popular high school student in the fictional Washington town of Twin Peaks.Most of the television cast reprised their roles for the film, though the majority of their scenes were cut and restored in Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces. A few notable cast members including Lara Flynn Boyle, Sherilyn Fenn, and Richard Beymer did not reprise their roles for various reasons. Boyle's character Donna Hayward was instead recast with Moira Kelly. Kyle MacLachlan, who starred as Special Agent Dale Cooper in the series, was reluctant to return out of fear of being typecast, which resulted in a smaller presence in the film than originally planned.Fire Walk with Me polarized critics in the United States upon its release but has received more positive appreciation in subsequent years,[5][6][7] with some critics viewing it as one of Lynch's major works.
