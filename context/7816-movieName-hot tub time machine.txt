A sequel, Hot Tub Time Machine 2, was released on February 20, 2015.Three estranged, depressed friends—Adam Yates, who was dumped by his girlfriend; neglected husband Nick Webber-Agnew working a dead-end job; and Lou Dorchen, an unemployed, alcoholic slacker in his 40s—reconnect when Lou is hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning. To cheer him up, Adam and Nick arrange for Lou to join them at Kodiak Valley Ski Resort, where the three enjoyed parties in their youth; Adam's nerdy nephew Jacob tags along. During a night of heavy drinking in their hotel room's hot tub, the four douse the console with an illegal Russian energy drink called "Chernobly". The next day, the friends go skiing and, after many strange occurrences (1980s fashion, music videos on MTV and Michael Jackson still being black), they realize they have traveled back to 1986. Adam, Lou and Nick have also assumed their younger bodies: they appear normal to each other, but to others (and in their reflections) they look like their younger selves.
