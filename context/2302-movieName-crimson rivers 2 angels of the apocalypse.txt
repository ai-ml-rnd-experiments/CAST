Crimson Rivers II: Angels of the Apocalypse (French: Les Rivières pourpres II: Les Anges de l'apocalypse) is a 2004 action thriller film movie starring Jean Reno, Benoit Magimel and Christopher Lee. It is directed by Olivier Dahan and produced by Ilan Goldman. It is the sequel to the 2000 film The Crimson Rivers (French: Les Rivières pourpres). However, the 2000 film's creator Jean-Christophe Grangé wasn't creatively involved in the sequel movie; instead, this sequel movie was written by Luc Besson, whose company EuropaCorp also co-produced this movie.After a body is found in the walls of a French monastery, Commissaire Niemans, played by Jean Reno, teams up with Detective Reda, played by Benoit Magimel, who is already investigating a murder of his own. As with the first movie, the pair's investigations intertwine and soon they are looking at a giant conspiracy involving a secretive group of monks on amphetamines led by Heinrich von Garten, played by Christopher Lee, searching for a treasure hidden by King Lothair II somewhere near the Maginot Line. Reno and Magimel are joined by a religious specialist called Marie, played by Camille Natta.This article related to a French film of the 2000s is a stub.
