The film received mostly positive reviews from critics and has since become a cult classic.[3]In September 1957, at a Chrysler Corporation assembly plant in Detroit, the hood of a newly assembled, red-and-white 1958 Plymouth Fury slams down without warning and crushes the hand of a line worker inspecting its front end. Another worker climbs in to sit behind the wheel, letting the ash from his cigar fall on the front seat. At the end of the shift, the line supervisor notices the car's radio is playing music; when he opens the door to shut it off, the worker's corpse falls out onto the floor.
