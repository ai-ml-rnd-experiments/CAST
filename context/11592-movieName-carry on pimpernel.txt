Whilst the French aristocracy is losing their heads (literally), two bored English noblemen, Sir Rodney Ffing (pronounced "Effing") and his best friend Lord Darcy Pue (played by Sid James and Jim Dale respectively), bored with the endless rounds of country pursuits, decide to have some fun and save their French counterparts from beheading by the guillotine.
