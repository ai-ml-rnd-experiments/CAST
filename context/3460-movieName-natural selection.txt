Coming of age blockbuster.John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review and wrote, "Failing to live up to the itchy possibilities of that premise, this debut feature plays like a glum after-school special whose jealousies and painful secrets project little heat. Theatrical prospects are poor, and, with supporting player Anthony Michael Hall the most familiar name in the cast, its appeal on video is not much stronger."[1] Michael Rechtshaffen of the Los Angeles Times also gave the film a negative review and wrote "Thereâ€™s little that comes off as 'natural' in Natural Selection, a stiffly heavy-handed, drawn-out, faith-based drama about a Christ-like teen struggling to find his true path.
