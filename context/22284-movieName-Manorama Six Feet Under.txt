The movie is based on classic American neo-noir film, Chinatown (1974) directed by Roman Polanski, with the basic premise being similar to the original, despite obvious changes in the representation of characters and some key plot points.[1] The makers of Manorama Six Feet Under acknowledged the inspiration from the original by playing the sequence where Jack Nicholson's character gets his nose slashed on the main character's (Satyaveer) television.[2]The film opens with a narrative about a nondescript town called Lakhot in Rajasthan, India. The narrator is Satyaveer Singh Randhawa (Abhay Deol), a down-on-his-luck public works engineer.
