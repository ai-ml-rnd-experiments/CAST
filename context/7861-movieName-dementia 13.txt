Dementia 13 (known in the United Kingdom as The Haunted and the Hunted) is a 1963 independently made black-and-white horror-thriller film, written and directed by Francis Coppola and produced by Roger Corman. The film stars William Campbell, Patrick Magee, and Luana Anders. It was released in the United States by American International Pictures during the fall of 1963 as the bottom half of a double feature with Corman's X: The Man with the X-ray Eyes.Although Coppola had been involved in at least two sexploitation films previously, Dementia 13 served as his first mainstream "legitimate" directorial effort. Corman offered Coppola the chance to direct a low-budget horror film in Ireland using funds left over from Corman's recently completed The Young Racers, on which Coppola had worked as a sound technician. The producer wanted a cheap Psycho copy, complete with gothic atmosphere and brutal killings, and Coppola quickly wrote a screenplay with Corman's requirements. Although he was given total directorial freedom during production, Coppola found himself at odds with Corman after the film was completed. The producer declared it unreleasable and demanded several changes be made.
