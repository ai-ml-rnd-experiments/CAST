Pale Rider is a 1985 American Western film produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, who also stars in the lead role. The title is a reference to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as the rider of a pale horse is Death. The film, which took in nearly $41Â million at the box office, became the highest grossing Western of the 1980s.[3]Outside the snowy mountain town of LaHood, California, armed men working for mining baron Coy LaHood destroy the camp of independent prospectors and their families. One of them shoots a dog belonging to 14-year-old Megan Wheeler. After burying her dog in the woods, she prays, asking God for deliverance, "If You don't help us, we're all going to die. Please, just one miracle." Thunder rolls, and a lone horseman astride a fine, pale horse, appears, riding easily but with inexorable purpose toward Carbon Valley.
