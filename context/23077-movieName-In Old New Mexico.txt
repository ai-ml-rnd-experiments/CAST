Released on May 15, 1945, it was the second of three Cisco Kid films made that year with Duncan Renaldo as Cisco and Martin Garralaga as Pancho.In this release, Cisco's real name is Juan Carlos Francisco Antonio. This version depicting Cisco as a road bandit is closer to the original Cisco character created by O. Henry in his 1907 short story "The Caballero's Way". Cisco and Pancho abduct Ellen Roth (Kenyon) when they hold up a stage coach. Once she tells her sad story about being a nurse being framed for murder of her charge, by the deceased's nephew Will Hastings (Willis), they agree to help clear her name. As part of trapping Hastings, they demand a $10,000 ransom to release Roth.
