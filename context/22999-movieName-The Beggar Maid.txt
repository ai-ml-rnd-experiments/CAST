Because of their different backgrounds, the Earl is unsure that a marriage will result in happiness. Will true love prevail?The poem by Tennyson and the painting by Burne-Jones which were the inspiration for the film:Her arms across her breast she laid;
 She was more fair than words can say;
 Barefooted came the beggar maid
 Before the king Cophetua.
 In robe and crown the king stept down,
 To meet and greet her on her way;
'It is no wonder,' said the lords,
'She is more beautiful than day.'

As shines the moon in clouded skies,
 She in her poor attire was seen;
 One praised her ankles, one her eyes,
 One her dark hair and lovesome mien.
