The Bedford Incident (aka Aux Postes De Combat) is a 1965 British-American Cold War film starring Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier and co-produced by Widmark. The cast also features Eric Portman, James MacArthur, Martin Balsam and Wally Cox, as well as early appearances by Donald Sutherland and Ed Bishop. The screenplay by James Poe is based on the 1963 book by Mark Rascovich, which borrowed from the plot of Herman Melville's Moby-Dick; at one point in the film, the captain is advised he is "not chasing whales now".[1][2][3][4][5]The film was directed by James B. Harris, who, until then, had been best known as Stanley Kubrick's producer. The two parted ways over a disagreement about the film that became Kubrick's noted Cold War nuclear-confrontation film Dr. Strangelove; Harris had wanted it to be told as a serious thriller, but Kubrick wanted it to be a comic farce (which it became). Harris remained focused on developing a serious nuclear-confrontation film, resulting in The Bedford Incident.
