All Hell Broke Loose is a 1995 Israeli documentary that follows the victims of a Hamas suicide bombing in Israel a year after the attack.The documentary shares interviews with victims of a 1994 Hamas suicide-bomb that detonated at a bus station in Afula just as a group of students were boarding. The film looks at the cycle of prejudice and violence that feeds on itself and perpetuates the conflict between Jews and Arabs.After the massacre, Israelis rioted and chanted, â€œdeath to the Arabs.â€ Some family members, outraged by the terror their loved one had faced, chanted along. But others realized that Arabs had been injured too, and a rare few worked even harder to promote understanding and peace between the divided people.The film shares the devastating effects of having survived a terrorist attack. One little boy who survived the attack now has burn scars all over his back and arms; he was robbed of his naivetÃ© and now stared at his playmates like a skeptical old man.
