Bunraku is a 2010 martial-arts action film written and directed by Guy Moshe based on a story by Boaz Davidson. The film stars Josh Hartnett, Demi Moore, Woody Harrelson, Ron Perlman, Kevin McKidd, and Gackt and follows a young drifter in his quest for revenge.The title Bunraku is derived from a 400-year-old form of Japanese puppet theater, a style of storytelling that uses 4-foot (1.2Â m)-tall puppets with highly detailed heads, each operated by several puppeteers who blend into the background wearing black robes and hoods.[1]The classic tale is re-imagined in a world that mixes skewed reality with shadow-play fantasy. Its themes draw heavily on samurai and Western films.[2]Bunraku premiered as an official selection of the Midnight Madness section at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival in Canada.[3][4] A limited theatrical release was slated for September 2011.
