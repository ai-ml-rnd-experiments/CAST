It is a loose remake of John Carpenter's 1976 film of the same name, with an updated plot.Former Marine and Detroit Police Department's Sergeant Jake Roenick leads a squad of undercover police officers in a drug sting that fails. A shootout ensues; Roenick is wounded and his entire team killed despite his best efforts.Months later, Roenick is burned-out, abusing alcohol and painkillers while clinging to his unambitious new assignment as a desk sergeant at Precinct 13, a soon-to-be decommissioned police station. On New Year's Eve, Roenick, along with veteran policemen Kevin Capra, Jasper O'Shea, and secretary Iris Ferry are the only people on site, since most of the officers have transferred or are taking time off for the Holidays. Psychiatrist Alexandra Sabian also arrives to evaluate Roenick's fitness for duty, as the reluctant and dismissive officer has consistently avoided their appointments.
