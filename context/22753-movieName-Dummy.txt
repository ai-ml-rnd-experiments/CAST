Dummy is an American series created by Cody Heller that debuted on Quibi on April 20, 2020.[2] The series is based on a real life experience between Heller and her partner Dan Harmon, in which she discovered that he had a sex doll.[3] The series was originally developed as a television pilot, but the script was rewritten as a film and then split into less than 10-minute episodes to fit into the concept of Quibi.[1]
