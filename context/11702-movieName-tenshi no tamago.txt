Angel's Egg (Japanese: Â§©‰Ωø„Æ„ü„æ„î, Hepburn: Tenshi no Tamago) is a Japanese art film[2] original video animation (OVA) written and directed by Mamoru Oshii. Released by Tokuma Shoten on 15 December 1985,[3] the film was a collaboration between artist Yoshitaka Amano and Oshii. It features very little spoken dialogue. Its sparse plot and visual style have led to it being described as "animated art rather than a story".[4]Angel's Egg follows the life of an unnamed young girl living alone in an undefined building near an abandoned city. She cares for a large egg which she hides under her dress, protecting it while scavenging the decrepit Neo-Gothic/Art Nouveau cityscape for food, water and bottles. In the prologue, an unnamed boy in militant garb watches an orb-shaped vessel covered with thousands of goddess-like sculptures descend from the sky. Awakened by the orb's whistles, the girl begins her day of scavenging, but soon crosses paths with the boy on a wide street traveled only by biomechanical roving tanks.
