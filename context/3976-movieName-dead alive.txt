It stars Timothy Balme, Diana Pe√±alver, Elizabeth Moody and Ian Watkin. The plot follows Lionel, a young man living in Wellington with his strict mother Vera. After Lionel becomes romantically involved with a girl named Paquita, Vera is bitten by a hybrid rat-monkey creature and begins to transform into a zombie, while also infecting the other townsfolk.Made on a budget of $3 million, Braindead was Jackson's most expensive film up to that point. Although it received positive reviews from critics, it was a box office bomb. It has since received a cult following, and is now considered one of the goriest films of all time.In 1957, explorer Stewart McAlden and his team smuggle a captured Sumatran rat-monkey, a hybrid creature that resulted from the rape of tree monkeys by plague-carrying rats, out of Skull Island.
