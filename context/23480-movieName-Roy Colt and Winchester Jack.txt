Sheriff Roy is then entrusted by the townsfolk with a replica of a treasure map said to lead to a fortune in buried gold, and his old partner Jack and a gang of desperados try to get to it first.Roy Colt & Winchester Jack was Produzioni Atlas Consorziate producer Mario Bregni's reward for director Mario Bava after he rescued the film Five Dolls for an August Moon.[6] The screenplay was written by Mario di Nardo, who had also written Five Dolls for an August Moon, a script which Bava did not care for.[6]Bava biographer Tim Lucas commented that following the release of Once Upon a Time in the West in 1968, Spaghetti Westerns seemed to be in competition with regard to which film could come up with the most flagrantly bizarre characters and situations.[3] This led to Spaghetti Westerns featuring martial arts, exploitive scenes of rape and gore, and gothic themes.[3] These extremities led to Bava approaching Roy Colt & Winchester Jack as a broad spoof of the genre.
