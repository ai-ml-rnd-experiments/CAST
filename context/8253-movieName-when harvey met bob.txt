When Harvey Met Bob is a 2010 television film, written by Joe Dunlop, dramatising the relationship between musician Bob Geldof and concert promoter Harvey Goldsmith as they organize the massive fundraising concert Live Aid in 1985. Directed by Nicholas Renton, the film stars Domhnall Gleeson as Geldof and Ian Hart as Goldsmith.[1][2][3]The film was first broadcast on 26 December 2010 on BBC Four and later in Sweden the following year.Critics praised Gleeson's performance as Geldof, but wrote that Geldof's mixed motives and the true toughness of Goldsmith were insufficiently explored.[3][1]In October 1984, rock musician Bob Geldof is appalled by the plight of starving Ethiopians which he sees on television news. He persuades his pop musician friends to record the million-selling charity single "Do They Know It's Christmas?". Determined to stage a massive live concert, Geldof brings in hard-headed rock promoter Harvey Goldsmith who provides a realistic foil to Bob's wish-list of performers. Preparations are fraught with arguments, and Geldof is disappointed to fail to secure Bruce Springsteen.
