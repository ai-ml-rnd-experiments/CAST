However, its release was delayed until the following year.[3] The film was released on May 8, 1937, four days before the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.The second theme of the final movement of Erich Wolfgang Korngold's violin concerto was drawn from the music he composed for this film.In Tudor England, two boys are born on the same day in the most different circumstances imaginable.
