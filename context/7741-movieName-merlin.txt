During his time there, Merlin learns that his magical powers must be used to protect Arthur, but must also be kept hidden because magic was banned in Camelot by Arthur's tyrannical father, King Uther Pendragon, and those caught practising it are executed. Over the years and after several adventures together, Merlin and Arthur become trusted friends and companions, with the former doing his best to influence the latter into becoming the mighty king he is destined to be, unaware of what his actions will do in shaping this destiny.Merlin received mixed reviews when it premiered, but gained good ratings that improved as the story progressed, becoming the most popular programme on the BBC's digital catch-up service, iPlayer. During its airing it was nominated for several awards, winning the 2011 British Academy Television Award for best visual effects.
