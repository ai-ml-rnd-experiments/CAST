Arthur 2: On the Rocks is a 1988 American comedy film and the sequel to the 1981 film Arthur. Lead actors Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli reprised their roles. John Gielgud, who won an Academy Award for his role in the original film, reappears briefly in a vision to Arthur during a drunken stupor. The film costars Kathy Bates as a woman who helps Arthur and Linda adopt a baby. Almost the entire cast from the first film reprised their roles, except for Jill Eikenberry, who was busy filming L.A. Law at the time. Because of this, the character of Susan was played by Cynthia Sikes instead.
