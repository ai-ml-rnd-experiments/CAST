Fantastic Voyage is a 1966 American submarine science fiction adventure film directed by Richard Fleischer and written by Harry Kleiner, based on a story by Otto Klement and Jerome Bixby. The film is about a submarine crew who are shrunk to microscopic size and venture into the body of an injured scientist to repair damage to his brain.[3][4][5][6] Kleiner abandoned all but the concept of miniaturization and added a Cold War element. The film starred Stephen Boyd, Raquel Welch, Edmond O'Brien, Donald Pleasence, and Arthur Kennedy.Bantam Books obtained the rights for a paperback novelization based on the screenplay and approached Isaac Asimov to write it.[7][8] Because the novelization was released six months before the movie, many people mistakenly believed that the film was based on Asimov's book.The movie inspired an animated television series.The United States and the Soviet Union have both developed technology that can miniaturize matter by shrinking individual atoms, but only for one hour.
