Aidan Quinn also stars, and it was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik.The film is perhaps best known for Depp's humorous physical comedy routines (which are based on silent film comics Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and Harold Lloyd) and for popularizing, in the United States, the song "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)" by The Proclaimers.[2] Benny & Joon was shot primarily on location in Spokane, Washington, while the train scenes at the beginning were shot near Metaline Falls, Washington.Benjamin "Benny" Pearl and his mentally ill sister Juniper "Joon" Pearl live together following the accidental death of their parents. Joon joins a poker game at the house belonging to a friend of Benny's named Mike, and loses a bet that commits Mike's cousin Sam to live with the Pearls. Benny is initially angry, but after an evening with Sam at the local diner and then coming home the next day to find Sam has cleaned the house, Benny decides Sam should stay.
