Flypaper is a 2011 American crime comedy film starring Patrick Dempsey and Ashley Judd, and directed by Rob Minkoff and written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. It was released on August 19, 2011.A bank is simultaneously attacked by two groups of robbers: three high-tech professionals and two rustic buffoons. One bystander (possibly an FBI agent) is quickly shot and killed, seemingly by accident, and eight hostages taken. One of the hostages, a customer (Tripp), notices several puzzling details, from which he guesses that coincidences were intentional: The robbers (among others) were lured here, with misleading blueprints and defective equipment, so that another criminal (the bank manager, Gordon Blythe, who is in reality mastermind criminal Vicellous Drum) – at the top of the FBI's wanted list of bank robbers – could kill them to cover his own trail. Tripp falls in love with Kaitlin as they are held hostage by a bunch of robbers and in the end it turns out that Kaitlin was the biggest thief herself. Tripp also correctly figures out that Kaitlin knew of Blythe-Drum's plan, and ultimately robs the bank with the security guards carrying out the loot for her near the end. Then, Kaitlin and Tripp drive off with the proceeds.
