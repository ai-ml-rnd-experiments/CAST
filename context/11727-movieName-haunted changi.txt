Changi Hospital is a now-defunct and abandoned general hospital located in Changi, Singapore. Its closure came with the merging with the former Toa Payoh Hospital and was renamed as the Changi General Hospital, which relocated new operations to nearby Simei, not far from Changi. It began winding down activities in February 1997 (completely abandoned in December that year) and remains abandoned to this day but is out of bounds to the public.What is now the abandoned Changi Hospital was first built by the British government in 1935 to complement other military installations like armouries and barracks in Changi, which was then an area with a large British military base that was intended to defend the eastern end (coastal areas) of the Johor Strait. The currently-empty hospital included two main military buildings constructed by the British colonial government, namely Block 24 and Block 37, both on a prominent hill (almost rarely referred to as Barrack Hill (pre-WWII) or FEAF (Far East Air Force) Hill (postwar)) overlooking the eastern Johor Straits and the nearby Pulau Ubin about a kilometre across the sea. Both blocks were a part of Kitchener Barracks, housing the British Army's Royal Engineers, and it is believed that Block 37 was commissioned and used as a small medical facility serving the barracks there. It is also speculated that not only did it serve the engineers barracked there, but artillery soldiers of the Royal Artillery in Roberts Barracks (currently Fairy Point Hotel) and the Gordon Highlanders in Selarang Camp (now the Singapore Army's 9th Division HQ Base), were also provided for at Block 37. These three British military units were based nearby from the hospital in the Changi area.
