Enchanted is a 2007 American live-action/animated musical fantasy romantic comedy film, produced by Walt Disney Pictures, Sonnenfeld Productions, and Josephson Entertainment. Written by Bill Kelly and directed by Kevin Lima, the film stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden, Timothy Spall, Idina Menzel, Rachel Covey, and Susan Sarandon. The film is live action/animated and its plot focuses on an archetypal Disney Princess, who is forced from her traditional animated world into the live-action world of New York City.The film is both a homage to, and a self-parody of, Disney's animated features, making numerous references to Disney's past works through the combination of live-action filmmaking, traditional animation, and computer-generated imagery. It marks the return of traditional animation to a Disney feature film after the company's decision to move entirely to computer animation in 2004. Composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz, who had written songs for previous Disney films, wrote and produced the songs of Enchanted, with Menken also composing its score. The animated sequences were produced at James Baxter Animation in Pasadena. Filming of the live-action segments took place around New York City.
