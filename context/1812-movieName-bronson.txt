Bronson is a 2008 British biographical crime film[3] directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, based on a script written by Refn and Brock Norman Brock. The film stars Tom Hardy as Michael Peterson, known from 1987 as Charles Bronson. The film follows the life of this prisoner, considered Britain's most violent criminal, who has been responsible for a dozen or so cases of hostage taking while incarcerated.[4] He was given the name Charles Bronson by his fight promoter, for his bare-knuckle fighting years.Born into a respectable middle-class family, Peterson became known as one of the United Kingdom's most dangerous prisoners. Because of his violence, Bronson was repeatedly put into isolation or solitary confinement, which may have contributed to his emotional problems.The film begins with scenes from Peterson's delinquent early life which he narrates with self-deprecating humour. Initially he addresses the camera dressed in prison garb; other times he tells his tale in a vaudeville-style theatre with a live audience.
