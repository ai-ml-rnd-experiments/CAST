The Age for Love is a 1931 American pre-Code comedy film (now lost[citation needed]) directed by Frank Lloyd based on the 1930 novel of the same name by Ernest Pascal.[1] The film was a vehicle for Howard Hughes' mistress Billie Dove.[2] The film was a commercial failure, but this did not stop Hughes funding another film for Billie Dove.[3] The film's music includes "I'm Chuck Full of Kisses" (music by Alfred Newman, lyrics by screenwriter David Silverstein) and "Just Another Night" (again by Alfred Newman, Con Conrad and David Silverstein).This article about a 1930s comedy-drama film is a stub.
