Violent Cop (ãã®ç”·ã€å‡¶æš´ã«ã¤ã, Sono otoko, kyÅbÅ ni tsuki, Lit. 'That man, being violent'), also known as Warning: This Man is Wild and So No Otoko Kyobo Ni Tsuki,[1] is a 1989 Japanese film directed by and starring Takeshi Kitano.[2] It was Kitano's directorial debut, and marked the beginning of his career as a filmmaker.[3]Kitano plays detective Azuma, a Dirty Harry-type who uses violent methods when confronting criminals. After the suicide of his friend and colleague Iwaki (a vice cop who was involved with drugs), and the kidnapping of his sister by yakuza gangsters, Azuma breaks all the rules of ethical conduct. He responds to every situation with violence, and resorts to unethical methods if they produce results.The Japanese title is the same as that given to the Japanese translation, by Makoto Sawa (ä½å’Œèª ), of James Hadley Chase's 1968 novel Believed Violent, published by Tokyo Sogen-sha (æ±äº¬å‰µå…ƒç¤¾) in the Sogen Mystery Library (Sogen suiri bunko: å‰µå…ƒæŽ¨ç†æ–‡åº«) series in June 1972. The phrase ã€Œãã®ç”·ã€å‡¶æš´ã«ã¤ãã€appears to suggest the wording of a police wanted poster ("This man, because of his extreme violence [should not be approached]"), but does not usually appear on Japanese wanted posters (shimei tehai: æŒ‡åæ‰‹é…), and may have been Sawa's own rendering of the English original.
