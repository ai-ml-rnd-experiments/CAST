Heavyweights is a 1995 American family comedy film directed by Steven Brill and written by Brill with Judd Apatow. The film centers around a fat camp for kids that is taken over by a fitness guru named Tony Perkis (Ben Stiller).When school ends for the summer, Gerry Garnerâ€™s parents send him to Camp Hope, a weight loss camp for boys. Initially reluctant, Gerry meets enthusiastic camp counselor Pat, and befriends the other campers, who have smuggled in enough junk food for the entire summer. The first night at Camp Hope brings the revelation that the original owners, the Bushkins, have declared bankruptcy and the camp has been bought by fitness entrepreneur Tony Perkis Jr, who plans to transform the campâ€™s weight loss program into a best-selling infomercial.Tony replaces the campâ€™s beloved activities, including go-karts and â€the Blobâ€, with a punishing exercise regimen. Pat is replaced by the strict new counselor Lars, and the campers endure a painful softball game against their more athletic, over-competitive rivals, Camp MVP. When Tony purges the cabinsâ€™ hidden food caches, camper Josh stands up for Gerry by taunting Tony, and is sent home without a refund, which results the other campers to theorize about what happened to Josh after this.
