Stuart Little 2 is a 2002 American live action/computer-animated family comedy film directed by Rob Minkoff and starring Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie, and Jonathan Lipnicki, and the voices of Michael J. Fox as Stuart Little and Nathan Lane as Snowbell the cat. Although a sequel to the 1999 film Stuart Little, the plot bears more resemblance to the original novel by E.B. White, in which Stuart and Snowbell must save a canary named Margalo (voiced by Melanie Griffith) from an evil falcon (voiced by James Woods).The film was released to theaters on July 19, 2002 by Columbia Pictures, and grossed $170 million against a $120 million budget.[3] It was followed by a third film, a direct-to-video sequel titled Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild in 2005. However, unlike these previous two films, which were hybrids of live action and animation, the third film was entirely animated.
