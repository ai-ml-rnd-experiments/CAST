When the studio shelved the film fearing that it would receive an NC-17 rating,[5] Zombie re-acquired the rights. They were eventually sold to Lions Gate Entertainment, who released the film in April 2003. Despite receiving an unfavorable response from critics it went on to gross $16 million worldwide. Since its release, the film has achieved a cult following, was developed into a haunted house attraction by Zombie for Universal Studios, and was followed by two sequels, The Devil's Rejects (2005) and 3 from Hell (2019).
