A hopeless romantic, he looks to find artistic inspiration in every woman he meets, but ends up only with despair and heartache. One day, his publisher asks him to come along to a book fair in Germany for a change of pace. There he meets Hee-jin (Gong Hyo-jin), a film distributor who is there to survey the European film market at an event in Berlin. Unsurprisingly, he falls in love instantly, and upon returning to Seoul, he writes her a love letter displaying his odd sense of humor, which convinces her to go out on a date with him. As their relationship progresses, Joo-wol writes a bestselling pulp noir serial with a main character loosely based on Hee-jin. However, with this newfound popularity he begins to discover more than he would like to know about his girlfriend’s complicated history with men.
