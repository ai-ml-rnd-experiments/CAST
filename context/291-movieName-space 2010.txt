2010: The Year We Make Contact (abbreviated on-screen as simply 2010) is a 1984 science fiction film written, produced, shot and directed by Peter Hyams. It is a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey and is based on Arthur C. Clarke's 1982 sequel novel, 2010: Odyssey Two. The film stars Roy Scheider (replacing William Sylvester), Helen Mirren, Bob Balaban and John Lithgow, along with Keir Dullea and Douglas Rain of the cast of the previous film.It is nine years after the mysterious failure of the Discovery One mission to Jupiter in 2001, which resulted in the deaths of four crew members and the disappearance of mission commander David Bowman. Blamed for the fiasco, Dr. Heywood Floyd resigned his position as head of the National Council for Astronautics.While an international dispute causes tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, both nations prepare space missions to determine what happened to the Discovery; the Soviet spacecraft Leonov (named after the cosmonaut Alexei Leonov) will be ready before the American spacecraft Discovery Two, but the Soviets need American astronauts to help board the Discovery and investigate the malfunction of the ship's sentient computer, HAL 9000, which caused the disaster.
