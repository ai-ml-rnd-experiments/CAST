The Charge at Feather River, a 1953 Western film directed by Gordon Douglas, was originally released in 3D with many arrows, lances, and other weapons flying directly at the audience in several scenes.[2]The movie is most notable for originating the name of the "Wilhelm scream",[3] a sound effect used in the Star Wars film series,[4] as well as countless other movies including the Indiana Jones franchise,[5] Disney cartoons and The Lord of the Rings film series.[6] In February 2018 it was announced that Star Wars will no longer use the Wilhelm scream.[7][8] Sound designer Ben Burtt named the sound after "Pvt. Wilhelm", a minor character in the film who emits the famous scream after being shot by an arrow (although the recording actually originated in the Gary Cooper film Distant Drums in 1951). When the film screened at the Second World 3-D Expo at Hollywood's Egyptian Theatre in 2006, much of the film-savvy audience broke into applause when Pvt. Wilhelm screamed.The climax of the film has many similarities to the 1868 Battle of Beecher Island, though instead of Army Frontier Scouts, Madison's character recruits "the Guardhouse Brigade" from Army prisoners and arms them with repeating rifles.
