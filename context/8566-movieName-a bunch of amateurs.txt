A Bunch of Amateurs is a 2008 British comedy film directed by Andy Cadiff, and stars Burt Reynolds, Derek Jacobi, Alistair Petrie and Samantha Bond.[1] In November 2008, the premiere in Leicester Square was attended by Elizabeth II.[2] The screenplay was written by Nick Newman, John Ross, Ian Hislop and Jonathan Gershfield.A washed-up Hollywood star is flown to England to play the title role in King Lear at "Stratford" believing he will be appearing onstage at the legendary RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of William Shakespeare. Instead he finds he has signed on with the "Stratford Players" in the Suffolk village of Stratford St John. He goes to the United Kingdom with his career deteriorating and having problems with his daughter who is an aspiring actress on the fringes of the New York theatre. The local villagers are somewhat of a motley crew and are naturally delighted to have such an - albeit unsuccessful - star playing with them. Reynolds plays a typically selfish American with no time for manners, and displays an appalling lack of class, considering himself too big for this lowly setting.
