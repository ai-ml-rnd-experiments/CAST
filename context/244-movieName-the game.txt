As the lines between the banker's real life and the game become more uncertain, hints of a large conspiracy become apparent.The Game was well received by critics like Roger Ebert and major periodicals like The New York Times, but had middling box office returns compared with its $70 million budget and the success of Fincher's previous film, Seven (1995).Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy investment banker, is estranged from his ex-wife and his younger brother, Conrad. He is haunted by having seen his father commit suicide on his father's 48th birthday. For Nicholas's own 48th birthday, Conrad presents Nicholas with an unusual gift—a voucher for a game offered by a company called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Conrad promises that it will change his life.
