The Other Me (Greek: ÎˆÏ„ÎµÏÎ¿Ï‚ Î•Î³ÏŽ) is a 2016 Greek crime film directed by Sotiris Tsafoulias.[1] The theater release was stopped after suspicions arose that a murder of a taxi driver may have been inspired by the film.[2]Inspired by Pythagoras' amicable numbers (Greek: Ï†Î¯Î»Î¹Î¿Î¹ Î±ÏÎ¹Î¸Î¼Î¿Î¯), a serial killer uses the number 220 as their mark, accompanied by quotes of Pythagoras. After two consecutive murders, the police hires young criminologist and lecturer Dimitris Lainis to help with the cases. Albeit plagued by his father's health issues, he takes the case. After a series of events, Dimitris discovers that a suicide incident and a fatal accident prior to the two murders reported by the police are linked to the murders, since the number 220 and quotes of Pythagoras appear in all four cases. A police officer working with Dimitris later states that all of the victims happened to participate in a trial, regarding the death of Kleio Rapti (ÎšÎ»ÎµÎ¹ÏŽ ÏÎ±Ï€Ï„Î®). Kleio Rapti died after she and her boyfriend were hit by a car, eight years ago.
