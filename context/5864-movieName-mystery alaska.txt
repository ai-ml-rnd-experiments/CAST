Mystery, Alaska is a 1999 American comedy-drama film, directed by Jay Roach, about an amateur ice hockey team from the fictional small town of Mystery that plays an exhibition game against the National Hockey League (NHL)'s New York Rangers. It was shot in Banff National Park and on the set of a town built for the purpose outside Canmore, Alberta.[1]Sheriff John Biebe is one of the townsfolk in Mystery, Alaska who play in "the Saturday Game" â€” a weekly hockey game played on an open pond. The entire hockey-mad town turns out every week to watch. Donna, John's wife, arrives with the latest edition of Sports Illustrated, which features an article on the town and the Saturday Game. While describing team members' strengths, it refers to John as being "slow in the feet"; but it concludes with a statement that in the ability to skate, the Mystery team rivals any team in the National Hockey League (NHL).Judge Burns and his son Birdie get into an argument about the game, with the judge saying that Birdie doesn't play well because he doesn't pass. During the next week, John is called into the Mayor's office to be told that he is being dropped from the Saturday game, in favour of Stevie Weeks.
