Renoir and cinematographer Jean Bachelet made extensive use of deep-focus and long shots during which the camera is constantly moving, sophisticated cinematic techniques in 1939.Renoir's career in France was at its pinnacle in 1939, and The Rules of the Game was eagerly anticipated; however, its premiere was met with scorn and disapproval by both critics and audiences.
