Fahrenheit 9/11 is a 2004 American documentary film directed, written by, and starring filmmaker, director and political commentator Michael Moore. The film takes a critical look at the presidency of George W. Bush, the war in Iraq, and its coverage in the media. In the film, Moore contends that American corporate media were "cheerleaders" for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and did not provide an accurate or objective analysis of the rationale for the war and the resulting casualties there.The title of the film alludes to Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel Fahrenheit 451, a dystopian view of the future United States, drawing an analogy between the autoignition temperature of paper and the date of the September 11 attacks; one of the film's taglines was "The Temperature at Which Freedom Burns".The film debuted at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival and received generally positive reviews from critics, but it also generated intense controversy, including disputes over its accuracy. The film was also awarded the Palme d'Or,[2] the festival's highest award. The film is the highest grossing documentary of all time and a follow-up, titled Fahrenheit 11/9, was released in September 2018.
