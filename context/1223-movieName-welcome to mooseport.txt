Welcome to Mooseport is a 2004 political satire comedy film directed by Donald Petrie, and starring Ray Romano and Gene Hackman (in his final film role). It was filmed in Jackson's Point, Ontario and Port Perry, Ontario.Former President of the United States Monroe "Eagle" Cole retires to his vacation home in the town of Mooseport, Maine, to escape from his ex-wife Charlotte. Harold "Handy" Harrison is the town's local hardware store owner and plumber. Harrison's job keeps him so busy that he has neglected his relationship with girlfriend (and the town veternarian) Sally Mannis, who is on the verge of dumping him.After the death of the town mayor, the town council decides to approach former president Cole about running for the office. Cole agrees because, if he is mayor, his Mooseport house can serve as his office and, therefore, can no longer be divided up or sold off in his divorce settlement. As a surprise to Handy, his name has also been entered into the race.
