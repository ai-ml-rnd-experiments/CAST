Scrooge is a 1970 British musical film adaptation of Charles Dickens' 1843 story A Christmas Carol. It was filmed in London between January and May 1970 and directed by Ronald Neame, and starred Albert Finney as Ebenezer Scrooge. The film's score was composed by Leslie Bricusse and arranged and conducted by Ian Fraser. With eleven musical arrangements interspersed throughout, the award-winning motion picture is a faithful musical retelling of the original.The film was a follow-up to another Dickens musical adaptation, 1968â€™s award-winning Oliver!. The posters for Scrooge included the tagline "What the dickens have they done to Scrooge?", designed to head off any criticism of an all-singing, all-dancing old skinflint.[1] Finney won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical/Comedy in 1971. The film received four Academy Award nominations, including for Best Original Song for "Thank You Very Much".
