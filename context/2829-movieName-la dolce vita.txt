La dolce vita (Italian pronunciation:Â [la ËˆdoltÊƒe ËˆviËta]; Italian for "the sweet life" or "the good life"[4]) is a 1960 comedy-drama film directed and co-written by Federico Fellini. The film follows Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni), a journalist writing for gossip magazines, over seven days and nights on his journey through the "sweet life" of Rome in a fruitless search for love and happiness. The screenplay, co-written by Fellini and three other screenwriters, can be divided into a prologue, seven major episodes interrupted by an intermezzo, and an epilogue, according to the most common interpretation.[5]La dolce vita won the Palme d'Or (Golden Palm) at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival[6] and the Oscar for Best Costumes.[7] It was nominated for three more Academy Awards, including Best Director for Federico Fellini. The film was a worldwide box-office success and a critical success, and is now frequently regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema.[8]By the most common interpretation of the storyline,[5] the film can be divided into a prologue, seven major episodes interrupted by an intermezzo, and an epilogue (see also Structure, below). If the evenings of each episode were joined with the morning of the respective preceding episode together as a day, they would form seven consecutive days, which may not necessarily be the case.
