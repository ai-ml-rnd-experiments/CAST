Das Boot (German pronunciation: [das ËˆboËt], English: "The Boat") is a 1981 West German war film written and directed by Wolfgang Petersen, produced by GÃ¼nter Rohrbach, and starring JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, Herbert GrÃ¶nemeyer, and Klaus Wennemann. It has been exhibited both as a theatrical release and a TV miniseries (1985). There are also several different home video versions of various running times, as well as a director's cut supervised by Petersen in 1997.An adaptation of Lothar-GÃ¼nther Buchheim's 1973 German novel of the same name based on his experiences aboard German submarineÂ U-96, the film is set during World War II and follows U-96 and its crew, as they set out on a hazardous patrol in the Battle of the Atlantic. It depicts both the excitement of battle and the tedium of the fruitless hunt, and shows the men serving aboard U-boats as ordinary individuals with a desire to do their best for their comrades and their country.Development began in 1979. Several American directors were considered three years earlier before the film was shelved. During production, Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, the captain of the real U-96 during Buchheimâ€˜s 1941 patrol and one of Germany's top U-boat "tonnage aces" during the war, and Hans-Joachim Krug, former first officer on U-219, served as consultants.
