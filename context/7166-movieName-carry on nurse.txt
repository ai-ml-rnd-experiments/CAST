Carry On Nurse is a 1959 British comedy film, the second in the series of 31 Carry On films (1958â€“1992). Of the regular team, it featured Joan Sims (in her Carry On film debut), Kenneth Williams, Kenneth Connor and Charles Hawtrey, with Hattie Jacques and Leslie Phillips.[2] The film was written by Norman Hudis based on the play Ring for Catty by Patrick Cargill and Jack Beale.[3] It was the top-grossing film of 1959 in the UK and, with an audience of 10.4 million, had the highest cinema viewing of any of the "Carry On" films.[4] Perhaps surprisingly, it was also highly successful in the US, where it was reported that it played at some cinemas for three years.The journalist Ted York (Terence Longdon) is rushed to Haven Hospital with appendicitis. The ambulance gets there at top speed, but only because the driver wants to know the result of a horse race.
