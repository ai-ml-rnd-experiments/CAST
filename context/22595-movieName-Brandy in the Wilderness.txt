Brandy in the Wilderness is a 1971 American drama film directed by Stanton Kaye. On December 18, 2013, the Library of Congress announced that this film had been selected for the National Film Registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".[1] [2]The film is a partly fictionalized account of the real-life professional and intimate relationship that developed between prodigious filmmaker Kaye and aspiring artist Michaux French, which began when they met in 1965.[3] Kaye's character is named "Simon Weiss" and French is named "Brandy," while their actual parents and other friends and acquaintances appear in the film, uncredited and often unnamed. Most of the scenes are depicted with either voiceover or without sound; only a limited number of moments feature live dialogue being delivered by the participants. These are occasional interjections of stock footage from major film productions, still photos of family members and well-known performers, and moments of blank screen featuring hand-dyed colors (which Kaye chose and supervised himself).Kaye as Weiss opens the film with a rundown of his history in the film business, describing or depicting important events, people, and locations he deems pertinent. Some scenes and stories are factual, such as Kaye's father's departure from acting work to sell women's clothes at farmers' markets, while others are fictionalized, such as moments purportedly depicting his early student film work.
