Goal! (also known as Goal! The Dream Begins in the United States) is a 2005 sports drama film directed by Danny Cannon and starring Kuno Becker as Santiago Munez, a young man with a rough background who is offered the chance to trial with one of England's top football clubs. The film was produced by Mike Jefferies, Matt Barrelle, and Mark Huffam from a script written by Mike Jefferies, Adrian Butchart, Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais.[3] It was made with full co-operation from FIFA, which is one of the reasons why actual teams and players are used throughout the film. The $50m deal that was struck between the producers and Adidas was, at the time the biggest ever between a corporate brand and a film production.[4]Santiago Mu√±ez, a Mexican illegal immigrant living in a barrio section of Los Angeles, is a skilled footballer who plays for his local team on weekends and dreams of playing professionally. The son of a gardener, Santiago lives with his father, Hernan, his grandmother, Mercedes, and his younger brother, Cesar. He works as a busboy in a Chinese restaurant while also helping with his father's gardening business for a living. Due to his poverty and the fact that he plays solely for a club made up of Hispanics from a local car wash, he feels his chances of making it as a pro are slim, until one day, Santiago is noticed by Glen Foy, a former Newcastle United player.
