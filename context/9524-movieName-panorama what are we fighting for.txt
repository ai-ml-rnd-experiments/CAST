A panorama (formed from Greek Ï€á¾¶Î½ "all" + á½…ÏÎ±Î¼Î± "sight") is any wide-angle view or representation of a physical space, whether in painting, drawing, photography, film, seismic images or a three-dimensional model. The word was originally coined in the 18th century[1] by the English (Irish descent) painter Robert Barker to describe his panoramic paintings of Edinburgh and London. The motion-picture term panning is derived from panorama.[2]A panoramic view is also purposed for multimedia, cross-scale applications to an outline overview (from a distance) along and across repositories. This so-called "cognitive panorama" is a panoramic view over, and a combination of, cognitive spaces[3] used to capture the larger scale.The device of the panorama existed in painting, particularly in murals, as early as 20 A.D., in those found in Pompeii,[4] as a means of generating an immersive "panoptic" experience of a vista.
