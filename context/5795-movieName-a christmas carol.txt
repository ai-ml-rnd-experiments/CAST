A Christmas Carol (also known as Disney's A Christmas Carol) is a 2009 American computer-animated dark fantasy Christmas film written and directed by Robert Zemeckis. It is a film adaptation of Charles Dickens's 1843 story of the same name and stars Jim Carrey, Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Bob Hoskins, Robin Wright, and Cary Elwes. The film was produced through the process of motion capture, a technique used in Zemeckis's previous films The Polar Express and Beowulf. It is Disney's third adaptation of the classic story, following Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983) and The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992), and only one of two films produced by ImageMovers Digital.A Christmas Carol was officially released in Disney Digital 3D and IMAX 3D on November 6, 2009 by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.[4] It had its world premiere in London, coinciding with the switching-on of the annual Oxford Street and Regent Street Christmas lights.[5][6] The film earned $325 million on a $175-200 million budget and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its visuals, Alan Silvestri's musical score and the performances of Carrey and Oldman, but criticized its dark tone. Due to its poor box-office performance, ImageMovers Digital was later shut down by Disney and re-absorbed into ImageMovers.
