Les Enfants du Paradis, or Children of Paradise in North America, is a two-part 190-minute romantic drama film by Marcel Carné made under war conditions in 1943, 1944, and early 1945 in both Vichy France and Occupied France. Set in the theatrical world of 1830s Paris, it tells the story of a courtesan and four men — a mime, an actor, a criminal and an aristocrat — who love her in entirely different ways.It is much acclaimed. "I would give up all my films to have directed Les Enfants du Paradis," said nouvelle vague director François Truffaut. In Truman Capote's The Duke in His Domain (1957), actor Marlon Brando called it "maybe the best movie ever made."[2][3] Its original American trailer positioned it as the French answer to Gone With the Wind (1939),[4] an opinion shared by critic David Shipman.[5] And a 1995 vote by 600 French critics and professionals lent it the plain tag "Best Film Ever."As noted by one critic, "in French, 'paradis' is the colloquial name for the gallery or second balcony in a theater, where common people sat and viewed a play, responding to it honestly and boisterously.
