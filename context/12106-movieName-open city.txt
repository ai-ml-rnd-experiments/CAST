Rome, Open City (Italian: Roma cittÃ  aperta, also released as Open City[2]) is a 1945 Italian neorealist war drama film directed by Roberto Rossellini and co-written by Sergio Amidei and Federico Fellini. Set in Rome in 1944, the film follows a diverse group of characters coping under the Nazi occupation, and centers on a Resistance fighter trying to escape the city with the help of a Catholic priest. The title refers to Rome being declared an open city after 14 August 1943. It forms the first third of Rosseliniâ€™s â€œNeorealist Trilogyâ€, followed by Paisan (1946) and Germany, Year Zero (1948).Open City is considered one of the most important and representative works of Italian neorealism, and an important stepping stone for Italian filmmaking as a whole. It was one of the first post-war Italian pictures to gain major acclaim and accolades internationally, winning the prestigious Palme d'Or at the 1946 Cannes Film Festival[3] and being nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar at the 19th Academy Awards. It launched director Rosselini, screenwriter Fellini, and actress Anna Magnani into the international spotlight.In 2008, the film was included on the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritageâ€™s 100 films to be saved, a list of 100 films that â€œhave changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978.
