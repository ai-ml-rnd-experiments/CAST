Friday is a 1995 American buddy stoner comedy film directed by F. Gary Gray in his directorial debut, and written by O'Shea Jackson (Ice Cube) and Mark Jordan (DJ Pooh). It follows Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and Smokey (Chris Tucker), unemployed friends who must pay a local drug dealer on a Friday. The film is the first installment in the Friday franchise and also co-stars Nia Long, Bernie Mac, Tiny "Zeus" Lister Jr., and John Witherspoon.While developing the film, Ice Cube and DJ Pooh expressed discontent regarding the portrayal of the hood in film, which they came to see as violent and menacing. As a result, they wished to counteract this, drawing on personal experiences when crafting the characters and plot points. Preparations for the film began after the pair were able to secure funding from New Line Cinema, who granted finance in exchange for a seasoned comedian in one of the lead roles; Ice Cube and DJ Pooh quickly settled on Tucker during casting.
