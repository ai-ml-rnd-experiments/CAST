Proudly She Marches is an 18-minute 1943 Canadian documentary film, made by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) as part of the wartime Canada Carries On series.[1] The film, directed by Jane Marsh and produced by Raymond Spottiswoode, described the work of Canadian women in uniform during the Second World War. The film's French version title is Carri√®res de femmes.In 1943, Canadian women are making a significant contribution in the military, disproving the old saw, "in the home women are good for everything, outside it, good for nothing." Other misconceptions about women's frailty, subservience to men and devotion to the pursuit of beauty have been in place for centuries. In modern times, when war came to Canada, Canadian women answered the call.Women signed up in the Canadian Women's Army Corps (CWAC), the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Woman's Division (WD) and the Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service (CWREN), taking on jobs that relieved men for combat duty. All new recruits went through the usual four-week basic training program, preparing them for military life.
