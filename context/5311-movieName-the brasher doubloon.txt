The course of his investigation leads Marlowe to realise that the source of the mystery hinges upon Merle Davis, the timid and neurotic secretary of Mrs Murdock.The novel was published in 1942. The New York Times said "Chandler has given us a detective who is hard boiled enough to be convincing without being disgustingly tough and that is no mean achievement.
