The Challenge is a 1982 American action film directed by John Frankenheimer and written by John Sayles, Richard Maxwell, and Marc Norman. The film stars Scott Glenn and Toshir≈ Mifune, and features several aikido-based action scenes choreographed by Steven Seagal, prior to the start of his own film career.A katana, one of a pair known as "The Equals", was an heirloom of the Yoshida family, passed down through the generations before being lost during World War II. It was finally tracked down and recovered in California by the youngest son Toshio. Hoping to return its rightful owner, his father Toru, Toshio hires down-on-his luck prize fighter Rick Murphy to smuggle the sword back to Japan.Upon his arrival, Murphy learns that the sword is a fake and himself a decoy, intended to ward off potential thieves. Aggravated that he has been used as a decoy, he is faced with the prospect of being killed by Toru's brother, a well-connected kuromaku (or "black curtain" in English, a fixer who works behind the scenes for Yakuza) named Hideo. Instead, he is advised to infiltrate Yoshida's martial arts school and obtain the sword.
