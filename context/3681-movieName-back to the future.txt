Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson. Set in 1985, the story follows Marty McFly (Fox), a teenager accidentally sent back to 1955 in a time-traveling DeLorean automobile built by his eccentric scientist friend Doctor Emmett "Doc" Brown (Lloyd). Trapped in the past, Marty inadvertently prevents his future parents' meeting—threatening his very existence—and is forced to reconcile the pair and somehow get back to the future.Back to the Future was conceived of in 1980, by Gale and Zemeckis. They were desperate for a successful film after numerous collaborative failures, their idea was rejected by over 40 studios because it was not considered raunchy enough to compete with the successful comedies of the era.
