It was directed by Robert Wise, produced by Harold Hecht, and starred Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster. The title refers to "silent running", a submarine stealth tactic. The story describes World War II submarine warfare in the Pacific Ocean, and deals with themes of vengeance, endurance, courage, loyalty, and honor and how these can be tested during wartime.In addition to Gable and Lancaster playing the leads, the film also features Jack Warden and is Don Rickles' film debut.[1]United Artists promoted Run Silent, Run Deep as a combination of the obsessiveness of Moby Dick's Captain Ahab and the shipboard rivalry found in Mutiny on the Bounty.
