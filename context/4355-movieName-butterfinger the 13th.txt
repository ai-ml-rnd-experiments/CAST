Butterfinger is a candy bar manufactured by the Ferrara Candy Company, a subsidiary of Ferrero.[1] The bar consists of a layered crispy peanut butter core covered in chocolate.[2]Butterfingers were invented by Mr. Otto Schnering in 1923. Schnering had founded the Curtiss Candy Company near Chicago, Illinois, in 1922.[3] The company held a public contest to choose the name of this candy. In an early marketing campaign, the company dropped Butterfinger and Baby Ruth candy bars from airplanes in cities across the United States as a publicity stunt that helped increase its popularity.The candy bar was also promoted in Baby Take a Bow, a film from 1934 featuring Shirley Temple.
