The Pee-wee Herman Show is a stage show developed by Paul Reubens in 1980. It marks the first significant appearance of his comedic fictional character, Pee-wee Herman, five years before Pee-wee's Big Adventure, and six years before Pee-wee's Playhouse. The show initially debuted as a midnight show in February 1981 at the Groundlings theater, and was later moved to Los Angeles' Roxy Theatre, where the HBO cable network taped one of the shows and aired it as a special that year. This TV special was released on DVD by Image Entertainment July 18, 2006. This nightclub show had more adult humor than the later children's television series.The root of that stage show was in 1980 when Reubens was one of 22 finalists to be chosen as a regular on Saturday Night Live, which was the infamous first season of an all-new cast, and one of five seasons without Lorne Michaels as a producer. Actor Gilbert Gottfried was chosen and Reubens thought his career was over. According to Reubens, he was about to return home when he came up with the idea of a stage show featuring the character he premiered back in 1977, Pee-wee Herman.
