Someone's Knocking at the Door is a 2009 American comedy horror film co-written, directed and produced by Chad Ferrin. The film stars Noah Segan, Andrea Rueda, Ezra Buzzington, Jon Budinoff, Silvia Spross, Elina Madison, Ricardo Gray, Lew Temple, Vernon Wells, and Timothy Muskatell. The film follows a group of drug-addled medical school students, Justin, Meg, Sebastian, and Joe, who are targeted by John and Wilma Hopper, a married sexually sadistic serial killer couple from the 1970s who rape their victims to death.Ray Harris (Jordan Lawson), a med student, sits in his dorm, watching stag films and shooting what at first appears to be heroin but is later revealed to be an experimental drug called "Taldon". He hears a knock on his door and answers it. He is greeted with the sight of a fully nude woman, who makes sexual advances towards him. He reciprocates, only for the woman to metamorphose into a grotesque man with a freakishly large penis. The man attacks Ray, and it is strongly implied (and later confirmed) that the man rapes and kills him.
