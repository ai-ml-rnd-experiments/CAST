Flower and Snake (èŠ±ã¨è›‡, Hana to hebi), released in 2004, is a Japanese film based on the 1974 movie Flower and Snake directed by Masaru Konuma and starring Naomi Tani. The earlier film, based on a novel by Oniroku Dan, was part of Nikkatsu's Roman Porno series. The 2004 version, directed by Takashi Ishii and starring Aya Sugimoto, has been described as marking a "watershed moment in the history of Japanese film censorship" with "some of the most extravagant scenes of sexual cruelty and graphic nudity to be passed off as mainstream entertainment in any part of the world."[2]On the surface, Shizuko is a beautiful and talented tango dancer married to a handsome and successful businessman Takayoshi TÅyama, but she is troubled by recurrent masochistic dreams and her inability to be sexually aroused by her husband. But her husband is heavily indebted to gangsters and yakuza boss KanzÅ Morita also has a video supplied by Kawada, a disgruntled former employee, which implicates TÅyama in a bribery scheme. Morita tells TÅyama that his only recourse is his beautiful wife who is an obsession to his mentor, the politically powerful Ippei Tashiro. When TÅyama finds that Tashiro is 95 years old, he convinces himself that turning his wife over to him will not be a major problem. When he brings his wife to the supposed masked ball, however, she is kidnapped and made part of a private bondage show for the elderly yakuza chief and his twisted friends.
