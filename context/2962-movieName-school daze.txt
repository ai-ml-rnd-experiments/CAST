School Daze is a 1988 American musical comedy-drama film, written and directed by Spike Lee, and starring Larry Fishburne, Giancarlo Esposito, and Tisha Campbell.

It also touches upon issues of colorism, elitism, classism, political activism, hazing, groupthink, female self-esteem, social mobility, and hair texture bias within the African-American community.[2] The second feature film by Spike Lee, School Daze was released on February 12, 1988 by Columbia Pictures.Vaughn â€œDapâ€ Dunlap is a politically and socially conscious black student at Mission College, a leading historically black college in Atlanta.

Dap's younger cousin Darrell â€œHalf-Pintâ€, a Gamma pledge, is ordered by Julian to bring a girl to the fraternity that night, and goes to Dap for advice.Cedar Cloud, chairman of Mission's board of trustees, warns college president Harold McPherson that the divestment protests may scare off the school's wealthy donors.
