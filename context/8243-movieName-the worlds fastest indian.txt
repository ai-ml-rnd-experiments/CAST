The film stars Anthony Hopkins, and was produced, written and directed by Roger Donaldson.The film opened on 7 December 2005 in New Zealand to positive reviews,[2] and quickly became the highest grossing local film at the New Zealand box-office taking in NZ$7,043,000;[3] and taking in over US$18,297,690 worldwide.[4] The film was theatrically released on 3 February 2006 in the United States by Magnolia Pictures; and was subsequently released on DVD on 22 December 2006 by Magnolia Home Entertainment.In 1962, Burt Munro is a sort of folk hero in his home town of Invercargill, New Zealand, known for his friendly easy-going personality, for having the fastest motorcycle in New Zealand and Australia, and for being featured in Popular Mechanics magazine. However, that recognition is contrasted by his exasperated next-door neighbours, some of whom are fed up with his un-neighbourly habits; such as revving his motorbike early in the morning, urinating on his lemon tree, and not mowing his grass. Burt, however, has a long-time dream; to travel to the US and test his motorbike's capabilities at the Bonneville Speedway.
