South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is a 1999 American adult animated musical comedy film based on the animated sitcom South Park. Directed by series creator Trey Parker, the film stars the regular television cast of Parker, series co-creator Matt Stone, Mary Kay Bergman and Isaac Hayes, with George Clooney, Eric Idle and Mike Judge in supporting roles. The screenplay, written by Parker, Stone and Pam Brady, follows Stan Marsh and his friends Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick as they sneak into an R-rated film starring their idols, Canadian comedy duo Terrance and Phillip, and begin swearing incessantly. Eventually, their mothers pressure the United States to wage war against Canada for allegedly corrupting their children, giving Stan, Kyle and Cartman no choice but to unite the other children, fight their own parents, and rescue Terrance and Phillip, while Kenny tries to stop a prophecy involving Satan and Saddam Hussein's plot to conquer the world.Primarily centered on themes of censorship and bad parenting, the film also parodies and satirizes the animated films of the Disney Renaissance, musicals such as Les Mis√©rables, and the controversy surrounding the show itself. The film also heavily lampoons the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA); Parker and Stone battled the MPAA throughout the production process and the film received an R rating just two weeks prior to its release. A writing team consisting of Parker, Stone, and Pam Brady was assembled and conceived numerous plot ideas, with Parker and Stone's being the one developed into a film. The film features twelve original songs by Parker and Marc Shaiman, with additional lyrics by Stone.
