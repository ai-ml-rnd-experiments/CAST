With the exception of Stifler (who has already lost his virginity), the youths make a pact to lose their virginity before their high school graduation.The title is borrowed from the song of the same name and refers to a scene in which the protagonist is caught masturbating with a pie after being told that third base feels like "warm apple pie". Writer Adam Herz has stated that the title also refers to the quest of losing one's virginity in high school, which is as "American as apple pie."The film was a box-office hit and spawned three direct sequels: American Pie 2 (2001), American Wedding (2003), and American Reunion (2012).
