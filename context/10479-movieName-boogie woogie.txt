Boogie Woogie is a 2009 British black comedy[1] film directed by Duncan Ward and produced by Eric Eisner and Leonid Rozhetskin. It is based on the 2000 novel of the same name by Danny Moynihan, who adapted his own book on the New York art world of the 1990s[2] and titled it based on the unfinished 1944 Piet Mondrian painting Victory Boogie-Woogie.[3]The film stars Gillian Anderson, Alan Cumming, Heather Graham, Danny Huston, Christopher Lee, Joanna Lumley, Charlotte Rampling, Amanda Seyfried, Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Jaime Winstone. It premiered on 26 June 2009 at the Edinburgh International Film Festival.[4]Boogie Woogie is a comedy of manners, its cast of characters devouring each other in a small world awash with big money. Set against the backdrop of contemporary London and the international art scene, it casts an eye over the appetites and morality of some of its major players. Dealers, collectors, artists, and wannabes vie with each other in a world in which success and downfall rest on a thin edge.I hoped it would be a film from the start, and even wrote it in an Altman-esque way, like Short Cuts, but it took ten years.
