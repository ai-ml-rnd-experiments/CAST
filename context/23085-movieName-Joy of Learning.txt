Joy of Learning (French: Le Gai savoir) is a 1969 film by Jean-Luc Godard.[1] The shooting started before the events of May 68 and was finished shortly afterwards. Coproduced by the O.R.T.F., the film was upon completion rejected by French national television, then released in the cinema where it was subsequently banned by the French government. The film is an adaptation of Emile, or On Education, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's treatise on education,[2] and its title is a reference to Nietzsche's The Gay Science.
