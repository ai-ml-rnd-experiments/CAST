Falling for her at first sight, he does not notice when she accidentally switches cell phones with him. She later gives Lynch's phone to her boyfriend Abe Klein (Andrew-Lee Potts) who works as a locksmith. When Lynch's employers try to assign Lynch another assassination over the phone, Abe and his pot-smoking slacker artist friend go to warn the victim, Mr. Fish (Terence Stamp), hoping for a reward. Concerned by Abe's behaviour over the phone, the employer has another operative, Virgil (Billy Zane), who does not know Lynch by sight, check up on him. The operative has a czech killer, Dragan (Karel Roden), brought in to deal with "Lynch".
