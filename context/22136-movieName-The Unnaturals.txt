The Unnaturals (Italian: Contronatura, German: Schreie in der Nacht) is an Italian-West German gothic horror film directed and written by Antonio Margheriti. It is loosely based on Dino Buzzati's short story "Eppure bussano alla porta" from the collection The Seven Messengers.[2]On a stormy night, a group of members of London's high society got stuck in the mud. They seek refuge in a remote country house. There they are received by the mysterious Uriat and his taciturn mother. Uriat explains to the guests that his mother has media skills and can communicate with the dead. Some guests are amused and persuaded to take part in a spiritualistic session. But when the old woman begins to tell those present details from the past, the mood quickly changes.
