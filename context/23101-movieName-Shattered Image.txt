Shattered Image is a 1998 thriller film written by Duane Poole and directed by Chilean filmmaker Ra√∫l Ruiz. It stars William Baldwin, Anne Parillaud and Lisanne Falk.According to academic Michael Goddard, this is a confusing and surreal film about complicated identities which "parallel David Lynch's moebius strip style films also dealing with parallel identities and realities that he was making at [the same] time, Lost Highway (1997) and Mulholland Dr. (2001)."[1]In an interview with film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, Ruiz calls Shattered Image an "American accident." He explains some of his opinions and experiences of the top to down "disconnected" filmmaking process in America. Ruiz says, "Shattered Image, I fought to make, and I now have a film about what it means to make a film in America - why American movies are the way they are. It's a very strange film because I thought about it in the terms of American movies.
