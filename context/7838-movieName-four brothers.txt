Four Brothers is a 2005 American action film[3] directed by John Singleton. The film stars Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andr√© Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as adopted siblings who avenge the death of their mother. The film was shot in Detroit, Michigan and the Greater Toronto Area.[4] It has been described as blaxploitation-influenced.[5][6]The seemingly random murder of their adoptive mother, Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan), at a Highland Park, Michigan convenience store, brings four brothers back home to Detroit, Michigan to find out what happened. Originally under the impression the crime was a simple robbery-gone-wrong, the brothers discover that the robbery was a cover for a hit put out on Evelyn. After this revelation, brothers, oldest and criminal Bobby (Wahlberg), third oldest, marine Angel (Gibson), second oldest, family man Jeremiah (Benjamin) and youngest, rock musician Jack Mercer (Hedlund), track down the hired guns who killed Evelyn. Refusing to give up anything, they are unceremoniously executed by Bobby and Angel.
