Half Baked is a 1998 American stoner comedy film starring Dave Chappelle, Jim Breuer, Harland Williams and Guillermo Díaz. The film was directed by Tamra Davis, co-written by Chappelle and Neal Brennan and produced by Robert Simonds. Though Half Baked was a box office failure and received generally negative reviews, it has since attained status as a cult film.[2]Four lifelong stoners and friends (Kenny, Thurgood, Scarface, and Brian) live together in New York City. Thurgood, a janitor at a medical laboratory, brings home some unusually potent marijuana given to him by a scientist at the lab, and the four smoke it. When Kenny, a gentle kindergarten teacher, is out on a munchie run, he is arrested for accidentally killing a diabetic police horse by feeding it junk food. His friends are forced to raise $1 million to bail him out before the other prisoners take advantage of his gentle nature.Scarface gets the idea to have Thurgood steal medical marijuana from his work so that the three of them can sell it to raise money to free Kenny.
