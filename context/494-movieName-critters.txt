Critters is a 1986 American science fiction comedy horror film directed by Stephen Herek in his directorial debut, and co-written with Domonic Muir and Don Keith Opper. It stars Dee Wallace, M. Emmet Walsh, Billy "Green" Bush and Scott Grimes in his film debut. The plot follows a group of small, furry aliens with carnivorous behavior escaping from two shape-shifting bounty hunters, landing in a small countryside town to feast on its inhabitants.Although widely believed to have been inspired by the success of Joe Dante's 1984 film Gremlins,[4][5] Herek has refuted this in interviews, pointing out that the script was written by Muir long before Gremlins went into production and subsequently underwent rewrites to reduce the apparent similarities between the two films.[6] The film grossed $13.6 million during its release in the United States, and spawned a Critters franchise consisting of three sequels, a web series titled Critters: A New Binge released on Shudder and a 2019 reboot titled Critters Attack!.On an asteroid prison, a group of dangerous aliens known as Krites are set to be transported to another station.
