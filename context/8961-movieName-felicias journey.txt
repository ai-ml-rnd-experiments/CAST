Hilditch regularly watches the old programmes of his presumably-deceased mother while he cooks her recipes and collects material about her. Hilditch offers to help Felicia; however, his motives for doing so are initially unclear, and it is subsequently suggested through flashback sequences that he has in the past befriended but then turned on vulnerable young women.Hilditch refers Felicia to a bed and breakfast and offers to drive her in his Morris Minor[1] to a factory that he suggests could be the one she is looking for that is on the way to the hospital where the unmarried Hilditch claims he is going to visit his wife.
