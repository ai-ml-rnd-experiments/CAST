Jaws 2 is a 1978 American thriller film[3] directed by Jeannot Szwarc and co-written by Carl Gottlieb. It is the sequel to Steven Spielberg's Jaws, and the second installment in the Jaws franchise. The film stars Roy Scheider[4] as Police Chief Martin Brody, with Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton[4] reprising their respective roles as Martin's wife Ellen Brody and mayor Larry Vaughn. It also stars Joseph Mascolo, Jeffrey Kramer, Collin Wilcox, Ann Dusenberry, Mark Gruner, Susan French, Barry Coe, Donna Wilkes, and Gary Springer.[4] The plot concerns Chief Brody suspecting another great white shark is terrorizing the fictional sea side resort of Amity Island, following a series of incidents and disappearances, and his suspicions are eventually proven true.Like the production of the original film, the production of Jaws 2 was troubled. The first director for the film, John D. Hancock, proved to be unsuitable for an action film and was replaced by Szwarc.
