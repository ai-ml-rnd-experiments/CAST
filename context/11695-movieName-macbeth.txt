Macbeth is a 2015 British-French epic historical drama film directed by Justin Kurzel and written for the screen by Jacob Koskoff, Todd Louiso, and Michael Lesslie. The screenplay is based on William Shakespeare's play Macbeth.[6] The film stars Michael Fassbender in the title role and Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth, with Paddy Considine, Sean Harris, Jack Reynor, Elizabeth Debicki, and David Thewlis in supporting roles. The story follows a Scottish general's rise to power after receiving a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Like the play it was adapted from, the film dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake.Macbeth premiered on 23 May 2015 at the Cannes Film Festival where it was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or.[7][8] The film was theatrically released by StudioCanal on 2 October 2015 in the United Kingdom and on 18 November 2015 in France. It received generally positive reviews from film critics who praised both Fassbender and Cotillard's performances, as well as those of the rest of the cast, the visual style, the script, the direction and the war sequences.
