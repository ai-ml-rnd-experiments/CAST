It is the longest-running film franchise, having been in ongoing production from 1954, with several hiatuses of varying lengths.[11] The film franchise consists of 36 films; 32 produced by Toho, and four by the American studios TriStar Pictures and Legendary Pictures.The first film, Godzilla, was directed by Ishir≈ Honda and released by Toho in 1954. It became an influential classic of the genre. It featured political and social undertones relevant to Japan at the time. The original introduced an acclaimed music score by Akira Ifukube, reused in many later films. The 1954 film and its special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya are largely credited for establishing the template for tokusatsu, a technique of practical special effects filmmaking that would become essential in Japan's film industry since the release of Godzilla (1954).
