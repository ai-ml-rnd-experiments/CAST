They Live (titled onscreen as John Carpenter's They Live) is a 1988 American science-fiction action thriller film written and directed by John Carpenter, based on the 1963 short story "Eight O'Clock in the Morning" by Ray Nelson. Starring Roddy Piper, Keith David, and Meg Foster, the film follows an unnamed drifter[nb 1] who discovers through special sunglasses that the ruling class are aliens concealing their appearance and manipulating people to consume, breed, and conform to the status quo via subliminal messages in mass media.The film was a minor success at the time of its release, debuting #1 at the North American box office. It initially received negative reviews from critics, who lambasted its social commentary, writing and acting; however, like Carpenter's other films, it later gained a cult following and experienced a significantly more favorable critical reception. It is now regarded by many as a largely underrated work. The film has also entered popular culture, and notably had a lasting impact on street art (particularly that of Shepard Fairey), while its nearly six-minute alley brawl between the protagonists makes appearances on all-time lists for best fight scenes.A homeless drifter, credited only as "Nada" ("nothing") comes to Los Angeles in search of a job. While out on the street, he sees a street preacher warning that â€œtheyâ€ have recruited the rich and powerful to control humanity.
