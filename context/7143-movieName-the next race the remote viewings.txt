Known as the "ghen" - a derivative of the word "generic" which humans labeled them asâ€”the genetically superior race rule from their underground utopia, Hollow Earth. Baron Crecilius Pryme, a charismatic political from Ume City, sets out to convince his fellow ghen that what remains of the human race must be eradicated because he believes they are forming a crusade to attack the ghen.
