Get Out of My Room is an album and short-form video featuring comedians Cheech & Chong, released in 1985. The album and video marked the last release by the longtime comedy duo, with Cheech leaving in 1986 in order to focus on his mainstream acting career. The opening track "Born In East L.A." and "I'm Not Home Right Now" were the only singles released for the album.The video was very different from the album. A 53-minute film, Get Out of My Room, was a mockumentary in the style of This Is Spinal Tap, written and directed by Cheech Marin. In the film, he and Tommy Chong are shown attempting to finish a "video album" for their novelty record Get Out of My Room.
