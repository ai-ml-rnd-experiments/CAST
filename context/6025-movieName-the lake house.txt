The Lake House is a 2006 American science fiction romantic drama film directed by Alejandro Agresti, starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock (who had previously appeared together in the box office hit Speed). It was written by David Auburn.[2] A remake of the South Korean motion picture Il Mare (2000), it centers on an architect living in 2004 and a doctor living in 2006 who meet via letters left in a mailbox at the lake house where they have lived at separate points in time. They carry on correspondence over two years, remaining separated by their original difference of two years.[3]In 2006, Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) is leaving a lake house that she has been renting in Chicago. Kate leaves a note in the mailbox for the next tenant to forward her mail, adding that the paint-embedded pawprints on the path leading to the house were already there when she arrived.Two years earlier in 2004, Alex Wyler (Reeves), an architect, arrives at the lake house and finds Kate's letter in the mailbox.
