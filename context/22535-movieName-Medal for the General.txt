Medal for the General (US title: The Gay Intruders) is a 1944 British comedy film directed by Maurice Elvey. The screenplay by Elizabeth Baron is based on the novel of the same title by James Ronald (published in the U.S. under the title Old Soldiers Never Die).The title character is General Victor Church, a proud World War I veteran who lives alone in a large house with his WW1 batman, Bates, and a few servants. Church was highly decorated in WWI, including a Victoria Cross and the Distinguished Service Order.At the onset of WW2 he goes to Whitehall to talk Major-General Lord Ottershaw (who was his adjutant in WW1) at the War Office to seek an active role in the War, after his numerous letters went unanswered. Despite their mutual respect, Ottershaw tells Church that he is too old, his experience out of date and that there was no vacancy for him.
