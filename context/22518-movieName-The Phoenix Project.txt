The Phoenix Project is a 2015 American science fiction film written and directed by Tyler Graham Pavey. Corey Rieger, Andrew Simpson, David Pesta, and Orson Ossman star as scientists who attempt to reanimate the dead.Perry Frank assembles a team of four young scientists to take part in an experiment to reanimate the dead. The group consists of himself, his friend and protege Carter Watts, biologist Devin Fischer, and engineer Ampersand "Amps" Garner. Although Devin and Amps are privately dubious about Carter's usefulness, the team members express their optimism and excitement for the project in taped interviews that Perry arranges. Perry explains that their funding only allows for five subjects, so they must proceed slowly and carefully. As they set up the equipment, Amps and Carter bond. Devin confides to Perry that his father, a scientist, experienced his greatest regret in having his work finished by later teams, and Devin says he wants to push this experiment all the way.
