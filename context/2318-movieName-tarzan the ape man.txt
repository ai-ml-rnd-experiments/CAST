Tarzan, the Ape Man is a 1981 adventure film directed by Gavin Brown and starring Bo Derek, Miles O'Keeffe, Richard Harris, and John Phillip Law. The screenplay by Melissa Reilly and Morton Schindel.[3] is loosely based on the 1912 novel Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs, but from the point of view of Jane Parker.The original music score is composed by Ernest V. Troost. Former Tarzan actor Jock Mahoney, billed as Jack O'Mahoney, was the film's stunt coordinator. The film is marketed with the tagline Unlike any other "Tarzan" you've ever seen! The original actor cast in the Tarzan role was fired (or quit) early in production, resulting in the sudden casting of his stunt double, Miles O'Keeffe, in the title role. This film received extremely negative reviews, and in some circles has been considered to be one of the worst films ever made, even though it was a box-office success.
