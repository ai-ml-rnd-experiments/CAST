Frankenstein (stylised as FRANKÆN5TÆ1N) is a 2015 updated adaptation of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, directed by Bernard Rose.The film is told from the monster's point of view as he is created, escapes into the modern world and learns about the dark side of humanity.Victor Frankenstein (Danny Huston) and his wife, Elizabeth (Carrie-Anne Moss), are scientists who bring to life Adam: a fully-grown, handsome, young man (Xavier Samuel) with the mind of an infant. Adam's cells fail to replicate correctly and he soon develops deformities on his face and body. Dr. Frankenstein attempts to euthanize his creation with lethal injections but Adam thrashes and screams as the chemicals surge through his body. Victor then chokes him. Later, two scientists attempt to dissect an apparently dead Adam but he regains consciousness and kills both men.
