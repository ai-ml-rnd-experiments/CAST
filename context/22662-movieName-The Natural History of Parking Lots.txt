The Natural History of Parking Lots is a 1990 American independent film written and directed by Everett Lewis. It tells the story of two estranged brothers who seek to reconcile their relationship against a background of criminal activity and violence. The film is Lewis' feature film debut.The Natural History of Parking Lots is set in Los Angeles the late 1980s. Chris (Charlie Bean) is arrested for stealing a car. His distant father (Charles Taylor) (who insists his sons call him "Sam" and not "Dad") arranges for him to be bailed into the custody of Chris's older brother, Lance (B. Wyatt). The brothers seem to bond, but there is always the suspicion that Lance is merely using his newly-domestic situation as a cover for his real business, gun-running.
