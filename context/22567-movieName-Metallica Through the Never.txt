Metallica: Through the Never is a 2013 American thriller concert film featuring American heavy metal band Metallica. Its title is derived from the song "Through the Never", from the band's self-titled 1991 album. It follows young roadie Trip's (Dane DeHaan) surreal misadventures, intercut with concert footage shot in Vancouver and Edmonton in August 2012.The movie features no dialogue, bar that of Trip's supervisor and the band – a concept similar to Pink Floyd's movie The Wall and Daft Punk's Interstella 5555. "We've obviously been influenced by some of the great music films of the past – The Song Remains the Same, or what Pink Floyd did with The Wall," said Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo. "But this is pretty unique. It's like a cross between Mad Max and The Twilight Zone."[7]It was the first feature released by the revived incarnation of the Picturehouse marquee, which had been shut down since 2008.
