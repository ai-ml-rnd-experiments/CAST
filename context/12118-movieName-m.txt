M (German: M – Eine Stadt sucht einen Mörder, lit. M – A City Searches for a Murderer) is a 1931 German thriller film directed by Fritz Lang and starring Peter Lorre in his breakthrough role as Hans Beckert, a serial killer of children. An early example of a procedural drama, the film centers on the manhunt for Lorre’s character, conducted by both the police and the criminal underworld.[2]The film’s screenplay was written by Lang and his wife Thea von Harbou and was the director's first sound film.[3] It features many cinematic innovations, including the use of long, fluid tracking shots, and a musical leitmotif in the form of "In the Hall of the Mountain King" whistled by Lorre's character. Now considered a timeless classic, the film was deemed by Lang to be his magnum opus.[4][5] It is widely considered one of the greatest films of all time, and an indispensable influence on modern crime and thriller fiction.[6][7][8]In Berlin,[9] a group of children are playing an elimination game in the courtyard of an apartment building, using a chant about a murderer of children.
