Burning Man is a 2011 Australian drama film written and directed by Jonathan Teplitzky.[1][2]Burning Man tells the story of Tom (Matthew Goode), a British chef in a Bondi restaurant, who seems to have chosen to disobey his boss, and his actions are tolerated by everyone around him. As Tom descends into darkness from a car crash in his Volkswagen, pieces of a different story start to emerge. Every woman around him tries, in different ways, to help Tom put himself back together.On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 74%.[citation needed]Fiona Williams of SBS awarded the film four stars out of five, observing that the film is an "experiential kaleidoscope of sex, love, and the numbing nihilism that accompanies a traumatic event." She also notes that "Burning Man manages to bring energy, originality and depth to a storyline that is itself something of a trope: ‘The Cancer Film’."[3]
