Maze is a prison film about the IRA Maze prison escape of 38 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners which was written and directed by Stephen Burke[1] it was released on 22 September 2017.[2]The Traditional Unionist Voice party said "After watching the trailer I am deeply concerned that the film is going to show a one-sided, very biased account of the Maze break-out. There is no account at all given in the trailer by the prison officers who served us during the Troubles."[3]Alex Maskey of Sinn FÃ©in said "At the end of the day a prison escape is of huge human interest worldwide so I have no doubt people will go and watch the film. I would recommend to people, go and watch it and make your judgement - I would hope it wouldnâ€™t glorify anything which is inappropriate.â€[3]As of March 2021 the film has a rating of 5.9/10 on IMDb.[4] The Playlist included it as one of their choices of underrated films of 2017[5]The film opened without previews to over â‚¬141,000 after its official release on Friday 22 September and was screened in more than 60 cinemas all over the island of Ireland.
