Thirteen Ghosts (also known as 13 Ghosts and stylized as THIR13EN Ghosts) is a 2001 American-Canadian supernatural horror film directed by Steve Beck. A remake of the 1960 film 13 Ghosts by William Castle, the film stars Tony Shalhoub, Embeth Davidtz, Matthew Lillard, Shannon Elizabeth, Alec Roberts, Rah Digga, and F. Murray Abraham. It was released to theaters on October 26, 2001, shot entirely around Lower Mainland, British Columbia.The film was critically panned upon release, with praise going towards the filmâ€™s production design but criticism towards the obnoxious sound design, lack of scares, bad acting, and excessive use of exposition. The film was also a financial disappointment, ultimately grossing only $68 million against its $42 million budget, and if accounting for marketing and advertising, the film lost money.[3]Ghost hunter Cyrus Kriticos and his psychic assistant Dennis Rafkin lead a team on a mission to capture a spirit called the Juggernaut. Several men, including Cyrus, are killed while the team is able to catch the ghost.
