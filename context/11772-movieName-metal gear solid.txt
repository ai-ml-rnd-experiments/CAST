Metal Gear (Japanese: メタルギア, Hepburn: Metaru Gia) is a series of action-adventure video games created by Hideo Kojima and developed and published by Konami. The first game, Metal Gear, was released in 1987 for MSX home computers. The player often takes control of a special forces operative (usually Solid Snake or Big Boss), who is assigned the task of finding the titular superweapon "Metal Gear", a bipedal walking tank with the ability to launch nuclear weapons.Several sequels have been released for multiple consoles, which have expanded the original game's plot, adding characters opposing and supporting Snake, while there have also been a few prequels exploring the origins of Metal Gear and recurring characters. The third game in the series, Metal Gear Solid for the PlayStation, marked the beginning of a whole new line of 3D for Metal Gear. As of December 2020, over 56.9 million copies of games in the franchise have been sold worldwide,[1] with individual installments critically and commercially acclaimed and receiving several awards.The series is credited for pioneering and popularizing stealth video games[2][3][4][5] and "cinematic video games".
