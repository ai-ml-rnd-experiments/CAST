Crime and Punishment U.S.A. (1959) is an American feature film, directed by Denis Sanders, and is â€“ as the New York Times put it â€“ â€œa beat generation versionâ€[1][2] of the novel Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.The film was released on November 1, 1959, is 96 minutes in length, and shot in black-and-white. In addition to making some changes in the plot and characterizations, it sets the tale, not in 19th-century Russia, but in mid-20th-century Los Angeles. The script was written by Walter Newman, and stars George Hamilton, in his first screen role,[3] as â€œRobert Cole,â€ the character based on Raskolnikov, the protagonist of the Russian novel.According to Hamilton, director Denis Sanders "saw his project as a tragedy for the Beat Generation" and cast Hamilton because of his similarity to Tony Perkins.
