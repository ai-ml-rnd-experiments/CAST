Since her parents (Janet Varney and Kristoffer Winters) are off to California, Judy is stuck with her young brother Stink (Parris Mosteller) and her free-spirt aunt Opal (Heather Graham). Her misadventures to have the best summer included a Bigfoot chase, activities ruined by her friend Frank (Preston Bailey), and putting hats on animals with Opal.Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer was the second project of couple and Smokewood Entertainment owners Sara Siegel-Magness and Gary Magness, following the commercially and critically well-received film festival hit Precious (2009).
