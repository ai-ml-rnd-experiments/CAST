The Benny Hill Show is a British comedy television show starring Benny Hill that aired in various forms between 15 January 1955 and 1 May 1989 in over 140 countries. The show consisted mainly of sketches that were full of slapstick, mime, parody, and double entendre (which could be described as a filmatographic version of British saucy seaside postcard humour).At its peak The Benny Hill Show was among the most-watched programmes in the UK with the audience reaching more than 21 million viewers in 1971.[2] In the late 1970s, the Thames Television version of the show found popularity in the United States and would run in syndication until 1990. Thames cancelled production of the show in 1989 due to declining ratings and large production costs at £450,000 (equivalent to £1,127,800 in 2019[3]) per show. In a 2015 UK poll the show's theme song was voted number 1 on the ITV special The Sound of ITV – The Nation's Favourite Theme Tune.[4]The Benny Hill Show features Benny Hill in various short comedy sketches and occasional, extravagant musical performances by artists of the time. Hill appears in many different costumes and portrays a vast array of characters.
