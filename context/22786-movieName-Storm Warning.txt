Lauren Bacall was originally cast in the part eventually played by Rogers. Bacall turned it down and was put on suspension by Warner Bros. for her defiance.[2]Marsha Mitchell (Ginger Rogers), a traveling dress model, stops in the town of Rock Point to see her newlywed sister, Lucy Rice (Doris Day). Within minutes of entering the town she notices unusual behavior by the townsfolk, such as dozens of people closing up shop and getting out of sight. As she walks down the almost-pitch-black main street, she hears loud noises coming from the police station. She hides and witnesses a drunken KKK mob, lynching a man whom they had just broken out of jail.
